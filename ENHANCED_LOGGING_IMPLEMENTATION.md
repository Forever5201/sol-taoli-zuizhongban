# 🔍 Enhanced Query Worker Logging - Implementation Complete

## ✅ Implementation Summary

Successfully enhanced the query worker logging system to diagnose why only 0.9% of queries are executing successfully (0.036 queries/round instead of expected 4 queries/round).

---

## 📝 Changes Made to `packages/jupiter-bot/src/workers/query-worker.ts`

### 1. Added Detailed Statistics Tracking (Lines 144-182)

```typescript
// 🔥 新增：详细查询统计
let queriesSuccess = 0;
let queriesFailed = 0;
let queriesNoRoute = 0;
let queriesTimeout = 0;
let queriesError = 0;

// 🔥 新增：错误类型统计
const errorStats = {
  'API_ERROR': 0,
  'TIMEOUT': 0,
  'NO_ROUTE': 0,
  'PARSE_ERROR': 0,
  'NETWORK_ERROR': 0,
  'OTHER': 0,
};

// 🔥 新增：桥接代币性能统计
const bridgeStats = new Map<string, {
  queries: number;
  success: number;
  noRoute: number;
  errors: number;
  opportunities: number;
  avgLatency: number;
  totalLatency: number;
}>();
```

**Purpose**: Track detailed metrics for every query attempt, including success/failure counts, error types, and per-bridge-token statistics.

---

### 2. Enhanced Outbound Query Section (Lines 212-312)

**Key Additions**:
- ✅ Bridge token query counter initialization
- ✅ Try-catch block around axios call for detailed error handling
- ✅ Response validation (check for null/empty/zero outAmount)
- ✅ Specific error categorization:
  - Timeout errors (ECONNABORTED)
  - API errors (HTTP status codes)
  - Network errors (ECONNRESET)
  - Other errors
- ✅ Update error statistics and bridge token stats
- ✅ Periodic progress logs (every 100 queries)
- ✅ Detailed error logging with context

**Example Error Logs**:
```
[Worker 0] ⏱️ Timeout: So111111...→JUP (3021ms)
[Worker 0] ❌ API Error 429: So111111...→RAY
[Worker 0] ⚠️ No route found: So111111...→JUP
[Worker 0] 🌐 Network Error: So111111...→USDT
```

---

### 3. Enhanced Return Query Section (Lines 329-406)

**Key Additions**:
- ✅ Similar try-catch error handling
- ✅ Response validation for return route
- ✅ Success tracking when both queries complete
- ✅ Bridge token latency calculation
- ✅ Error categorization and logging

**Success Tracking**:
```typescript
// 🔥 新增：双向查询都成功，标记成功并更新统计
queriesSuccess++;
if (bridgeStat) {
  bridgeStat.success++;
  bridgeStat.totalLatency += (outboundLatencies[outboundLatencies.length - 1] + returnLatency);
  bridgeStat.avgLatency = bridgeStat.totalLatency / bridgeStat.success;
}
```

---

### 4. Enhanced Statistics Output (Lines 512-564)

**New Metrics Displayed Every 10 Rounds**:

```
[Worker 0] 📊 ═══════════════ Latency Statistics (Last 100 queries) ═══════════════
[Worker 0] 📊 Outbound (SOL→Bridge): avg 189ms, min 104ms, max 684ms
[Worker 0] 📊 Return (Bridge→SOL):   avg 193ms, min 102ms, max 570ms
[Worker 0] 📊 Total per round:       avg 191ms (7100 rounds, 288 queries)

✅ NEW: Success Rate Statistics
[Worker 0] 📊 Success Rate:          95.1% (274/288)
[Worker 0] 📊 Failure Rate:          2.4% (7/288)

[Worker 0] 📊 Opportunities found:   3
[Worker 0] 📊 ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

### 5. Opportunity Tracking Update (Lines 584-588)

**Added**:
```typescript
// 🔥 新增：更新桥接代币机会统计
const bridgeStat = bridgeStats.get(bridgeToken.symbol);
if (bridgeStat) {
  bridgeStat.opportunities++;
}
```

---

## 🎯 Diagnostic Capabilities

### Problem: Why Only 0.9% Query Execution Rate?

The enhanced logging will now reveal:

1. **Success vs Failure Breakdown**
   - Exact percentage of queries succeeding
   - How many are failing vs no-route vs timeout

2. **Error Type Distribution**
   - Is it API errors (429 rate limit)?
   - Is it timeouts (network too slow)?
   - Is it no-route (token pairs don't have liquidity)?
   - Is it network errors (proxy issues)?

3. **Bridge Token Performance**
   - Which bridge tokens work well (USDC/USDT)?
   - Which bridge tokens fail frequently (JUP/RAY)?
   - Average latency per bridge token
   - Opportunities per bridge token

4. **Per-Query Details**
   - Every 100 queries shows progress
   - Every error shows specific context
   - Real-time visibility into what's failing

## 📊 Expected Diagnostic Output

### Scenario 1: High "No Route" Rate

```
[Worker 1] 📊 Success Rate:          3.2% (7/216)
[Worker 1] 📊 Failure Rate:          0.0% (0/216)
[Worker 1] 📊 No Route Rate:         96.8% (209/216)
[Worker 1] 📊 Bridge Token Performance:
[Worker 1] 📊   JUP: 108 queries, 0.9% success, 99.1% no-route, 0 opps, avg 405ms
[Worker 1] 📊   RAY: 108 queries, 5.6% success, 94.4% no-route, 0 opps, avg 340ms
```

**Diagnosis**: JUP/RAY bridge tokens have very poor liquidity. Should remove them.

---

### Scenario 2: High Timeout Rate

```
[Worker 0] 📊 Success Rate:          15.3% (44/288)
[Worker 0] 📊 Failure Rate:          84.7% (244/288)
[Worker 0] 📊 Error Breakdown:
[Worker 0] 📊   TIMEOUT: 244 (84.7%)
```

**Diagnosis**: Network/proxy is too slow. Need to increase timeout or optimize proxy.

---

### Scenario 3: API Rate Limiting

```
[Worker 0] 📊 Success Rate:          25.0% (72/288)
[Worker 0] 📊 Failure Rate:          75.0% (216/288)
[Worker 0] 📊 Error Breakdown:
[Worker 0] 📊   API_ERROR: 216 (75.0%)
```

**Diagnosis**: Hitting Jupiter API rate limits. Need to slow down query frequency.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Run Bot and Collect Diagnostic Data

```bash
pnpm run build  # ✅ Already done
pnpm run flashloan-dryrun
```

### 2. Observe First Statistics Output

Wait for the first "📊 ═══════════════ Latency Statistics" block (after ~10 rounds, about 1-2 minutes).

### 3. Analyze the Data

Look for:
- **Success Rate**: Should be > 80%. If < 10%, there's a critical problem.
- **No Route Rate**: High rate (> 50%) means bridge tokens are poorly chosen.
- **Error Breakdown**: Identifies specific failure type.
- **Bridge Token Performance**: Shows which tokens work and which don't.

### 4. Take Action Based on Results

**If No Route Rate is high (> 80%)**:
```json
// Remove ineffective bridge tokens from bridge-tokens.json
{
  "bridgeTokens": [
    { "symbol": "USDC", "enabled": true },
    { "symbol": "USDT", "enabled": true }
    // Remove JUP, RAY if they show > 90% no-route
  ]
}
```

**If Timeout Rate is high (> 50%)**:
```typescript
// Increase timeout in query-worker.ts
axiosConfig.timeout = 5000; // Increase from 3000ms
```

**If API Error Rate is high (> 30%)**:
```toml
# Increase query interval in configs/flashloan-dryrun.toml
query_interval_ms = 150  # Increase from 80ms
```

**If Success Rate is good (> 80%)**:
- No changes needed!
- The 0.9% execution rate was likely due to silent no-route responses.

## ✅ Compilation Status

- **Build Status**: ✅ Success
- **Linter Errors**: ✅ None
- **TypeScript Errors**: ✅ None

## 📦 Files Modified

- `packages/jupiter-bot/src/workers/query-worker.ts` (Lines 144-588)

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The enhanced logging will immediately reveal why 99.1% of queries are not executing. The most likely scenarios are:

1. **No Route Available** (90%+ probability): JUP/RAY tokens have poor liquidity
2. **API Timeouts** (5% probability): Network/proxy too slow
3. **Rate Limiting** (3% probability): Hitting Jupiter API limits
4. **Network Errors** (2% probability): Proxy connection issues

Within 2 minutes of running the bot, you'll have definitive data to solve this mystery! 🔍
