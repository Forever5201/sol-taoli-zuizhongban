# Plan B Rate Limit Optimization - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-24  
**Time**: [Current Time]  
**Status**: Configuration updated, bot started for 30-minute test

---

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. Bridge Tokens Configuration (`bridge-tokens.json`)

**Added 2 new bridge tokens**:
- ✅ **mSOL** (Marinade Staked SOL)
  - Mint: `mSoLzYCxHdYgdzU16g5QSh3i5K3z3KZK7ytfqcJm7So`
  - Decimals: 9
  - Priority: 3
  - Enabled: true

- ✅ **jitoSOL** (Jito Staked SOL)
  - Mint: `J1toso1uCk3RLmjorhTtrVwY9HJ7X8V9yYac6Y7kGCPn`
  - Decimals: 9
  - Priority: 4
  - Enabled: true

**Total enabled tokens**: 4 (USDC, USDT, mSOL, jitoSOL)

### 2. Worker Configuration (`configs/flashloan-dryrun.toml`)

**Updated parameters**:
```toml
worker_count = 4        # Changed from: 1
query_interval_ms = 3000  # Changed from: 2000
```

**Added detailed configuration comments**:
- Worker assignment strategy (each worker handles 1 token)
- Rate limit calculation (54% utilization)
- Safety margin explanation (46%)

### 3. Project Rebuild

- ✅ Cleaned `dist/` directory
- ✅ Rebuilt with `pnpm run build`
- ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors

---

## 📊 Expected Configuration Behavior

### Worker Assignment (Automatic)
```
Worker 0 → USDC (highest liquidity, most stable)
Worker 1 → USDT (high liquidity, stable)
Worker 2 → mSOL (medium liquidity, staking derivative)
Worker 3 → jitoSOL (medium liquidity, Jito ecosystem)
```

### Rate Limit Calculations
```
Ultra API Base Limit: 50 requests per 10 seconds

Current Configuration:
- 4 Workers
- 3 second interval per worker
- 2 API calls per query (outbound + return)

Calculation:
  Rounds per 10s = 10 ÷ 3 = 3.33 rounds
  Total API calls = 4 workers × 3.33 rounds × 2 calls = 26.67 calls/10s
  Utilization = 26.67 ÷ 50 = 53.3%
  
Safety margin: 46.7%
Per-minute rate: ~160 calls/min (vs 300 limit)
```

### Comparison vs Previous (1 Worker)

| Metric | 1 Worker (Stable) | 4 Workers (Plan B) | Change |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Worker Count** | 1 | 4 | +300% |
| **Query Interval** | 2s | 3s | +50% |
| **Bridge Tokens** | 2 | 4 | +100% |
| **API Calls/min** | 60 | 160 | +167% |
| **API Utilization** | 20% | 54% | +34pp |
| **Throughput** | Baseline | 2.67x | - |

## 🎯 Test Plan - Next 30 Minutes

### Critical Monitoring Points

**10-Minute Checkpoint** ⏰
- [ ] Verify 4 workers started successfully
- [ ] Check success rate > 80% (minimum threshold)
- [ ] Check network errors < 20%
- [ ] **Decision**: Continue or immediate rollback

**20-Minute Checkpoint** ⏰
- [ ] Monitor success rate trend
- [ ] Check for persistent errors
- [ ] Verify opportunities increasing vs baseline

**30-Minute Final Evaluation** ⏰
- [ ] Overall success rate ≥ 90% (target)
- [ ] Network error rate < 10%
- [ ] No 429 rate limit errors
- [ ] Opportunities found > 1-worker baseline
- [ ] **Decision**: Commit or rollback

### What to Watch in Logs

**✅ Good Signs**:
```
Workers: 4
Query Interval: 3000ms
Worker 0 assigned 1 bridge tokens: [USDC]
Worker 1 assigned 1 bridge tokens: [USDT]
Worker 2 assigned 1 bridge tokens: [mSOL]
Worker 3 assigned 1 bridge tokens: [jitoSOL]

[Worker 0] ✅ Quote outbound: So11...→USDC, took 350ms
[Worker 1] ✅ Quote outbound: So11...→USDT, took 380ms

Success Rate: 90-100%
Opportunities found: 10-40
```

**⚠️ Warning Signs**:
```
[Worker X] 🌐 Network Error: read ECONNRESET (occasional is OK)
Success Rate: 80-90% (marginal, watch closely)
mSOL/jitoSOL: "No route found" (acceptable if USDC/USDT > 95%)
```

**❌ Critical Issues (Rollback Immediately)**:
```
[Worker X] 🌐 Network Error: read ECONNRESET (repeated)
Success Rate: < 80%
Network errors > 20%
429 Rate Limit errors
Proxy showing overload
```

## 📝 Success Criteria

### Primary Metrics (Must Pass)
1. ✅ Overall success rate ≥ 90%
2. ✅ Network error rate < 10%
3. ✅ No 429 rate limit errors
4. ✅ All 4 workers operational

### Secondary Metrics (Should Pass)
5. ✅ USDC: 95-100% success
6. ✅ USDT: 95-100% success
7. ✅ mSOL: 70-90% success (acceptable)
8. ✅ jitoSOL: 70-90% success (acceptable)
9. ✅ Opportunities > baseline

### Acceptable Deviations
- mSOL/jitoSOL may have higher "No route found" (10 SOL is large for staking derivatives)
- Occasional ECONNRESET (< 5 per 30 min) is normal
- Average latency 400-600ms is acceptable

## 🔄 Decision Tree

```
After 10 minutes:
├─ Success rate < 80%? → ROLLBACK IMMEDIATELY
├─ Network errors > 20%? → ROLLBACK IMMEDIATELY
└─ Otherwise → Continue to 30 minutes

After 30 minutes:
├─ Success rate ≥ 90%? 
│  ├─ Yes → COMMIT changes
│  └─ No (85-90%) → Evaluate:
│     ├─ USDC/USDT > 95%? → Consider COMMIT
│     └─ Otherwise → ROLLBACK
└─ Success rate < 85%? → ROLLBACK
```

## ✅ If Test Passes - Commit Script

```bash
git add configs/flashloan-dryrun.toml bridge-tokens.json
git commit -m "feat: implement Plan B rate limit optimization (4 workers, 4 tokens)

Configuration changes:
- Increase worker_count from 1 to 4
- Increase query_interval_ms from 2000 to 3000
- Enable 4 bridge tokens: USDC, USDT, mSOL, jitoSOL
- Each worker handles 1 specific token (reduce conflicts)

Rate limit optimization:
- API calls: 4 workers × (60÷3) × 2 = 160 calls/min
- Utilization: 27 calls/10s ÷ 50 limit = 54%
- Safety margin: 46% for network jitter

Test results (30 minutes):
- Overall success rate: [FILL IN]%
- USDC: [FILL IN]% | USDT: [FILL IN]% | mSOL: [FILL IN]% | jitoSOL: [FILL IN]%
- Network errors: [FILL IN] occurrences
- Opportunities found: [FILL IN] (vs baseline with 1 worker)
- No 429 rate limit errors
- Proxy stable under 4-worker load

Expected benefits:
- 2-4x opportunity discovery rate
- Better market coverage (4 token pairs)
- Maintained stability with 54% API utilization"

git push

## ❌ If Test Fails - Rollback Script

```bash
# Quick rollback
git checkout HEAD -- configs/flashloan-dryrun.toml bridge-tokens.json

# Rebuild
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force dist/
pnpm run build

# Restart with stable config
pnpm run flashloan-dryrun
```

**Then analyze**:
1. Why did it fail? (proxy capacity, liquidity, network)
2. Alternative: Try 2 workers first?
3. Alternative: Use only USDC + USDT?
4. Need proxy upgrade?

## 📊 Risk Assessment

### High Risk: Proxy Overload
- **Likelihood**: Medium-High
- **Mitigation**: 3s interval (vs 2s), 46% safety margin
- **Rollback**: Ready if needed

### Medium Risk: Staking Derivative Liquidity
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Impact**: May reduce overall success to 85-90%
- **Acceptable**: If USDC/USDT maintain 95%+

### Low Risk: API Rate Limit
- **Likelihood**: Very Low
- **Mitigation**: 54% utilization well below limit
- **Indicator**: No 429 errors expected

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

### Best Case (>95% success)
- All 4 tokens work perfectly
- 3-4x opportunity discovery
- Proxy handles load easily
- Future: Can consider 2.5s interval

### Target Case (90-95% success) ⭐
- USDC/USDT: 95-100% success
- mSOL/jitoSOL: 80-90% success
- 2-3x opportunity discovery
- **This is the goal!**

### Acceptable Case (85-90% success)
- Some network errors but manageable
- mSOL/jitoSOL struggle but operational
- 2x opportunity discovery
- May need tuning

### Failure Case (<85% success)
- Proxy cannot handle 4 workers
- Excessive network errors
- Rollback required
- Infrastructure upgrade needed

## 🎓 Key Learnings from Previous Tests

**From b391add success**:
- 1 Worker + 2 tokens = 100% success rate
- Proxy can handle single worker perfectly
- USDC/USDT are very stable

**From 4 Worker failure (before)**:
- 4 Workers + 2s interval = proxy overload
- 50% success rate, ECONNRESET errors
- Reason: concurrent load too high

**Plan B hypothesis**:
- 4 Workers + 3s interval = proxy can handle?
- 3s interval gives 50% more recovery time
- Should reduce concurrent pressure
