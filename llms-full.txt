A technical deep dive into Jupiter's most comprehensive trading engine, featuring exclusive new capabilities: Iris, ShadowLane, Predictive Execution and more.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/jupiter/QHGHMXOYjCMT2PUx/static/blog/ultra-v3/ultra-v3.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=QHGHMXOYjCMT2PUx&q=85&s=55e66741230595d5dbcf514a957c0c48" alt="Ultra Swap V3" data-og-width="800" width="800" data-og-height="400" height="400" data-path="static/blog/ultra-v3/ultra-v3.png" data-optimize="true" data-opv="3" srcset="https://mintcdn.com/jupiter/QHGHMXOYjCMT2PUx/static/blog/ultra-v3/ultra-v3.png?w=280&fit=max&auto=format&n=QHGHMXOYjCMT2PUx&q=85&s=bf1cf9e50b83752cb533535a8fe49e61 280w, https://mintcdn.com/jupiter/QHGHMXOYjCMT2PUx/static/blog/ultra-v3/ultra-v3.png?w=560&fit=max&auto=format&n=QHGHMXOYjCMT2PUx&q=85&s=d9d057af9139db1483a386ce03a91b48 560w, https://mintcdn.com/jupiter/QHGHMXOYjCMT2PUx/static/blog/ultra-v3/ultra-v3.png?w=840&fit=max&auto=format&n=QHGHMXOYjCMT2PUx&q=85&s=7e864217f639869e85211e6335c74ece 840w, https://mintcdn.com/jupiter/QHGHMXOYjCMT2PUx/static/blog/ultra-v3/ultra-v3.png?w=1100&fit=max&auto=format&n=QHGHMXOYjCMT2PUx&q=85&s=b2cbc74d37abd8bcc0a41dff21635291 1100w, https://mintcdn.com/jupiter/QHGHMXOYjCMT2PUx/static/blog/ultra-v3/ultra-v3.png?w=1650&fit=max&auto=format&n=QHGHMXOYjCMT2PUx&q=85&s=43d850d54f4bc51627873cd9124b3043 1650w, https://mintcdn.com/jupiter/QHGHMXOYjCMT2PUx/static/blog/ultra-v3/ultra-v3.png?w=2500&fit=max&auto=format&n=QHGHMXOYjCMT2PUx&q=85&s=63ab5bed02360b364b954c87deb50071 2500w" />

Ultra V3 is the culmination of months of infrastructure work, algorithm optimization, and real-world
testing in production. This release introduces Iris, ShadowLane, Predictive Execution, and more - fundamentally
transforming swap execution with measurable improvements at every level - resulting in the Best Price, Best Execution
and Best Protection.

***

## Improved Routers in Meta Aggregation

Ultra uses meta aggregation to compare and aggregate quotes from various liquidity sources such as
our own routers like Iris and JupiterZ, and 3rd party routers like Dflow, Hashflow, and OKX to find
you the best pricing from various liquidity sources.

<Card title="Iris: Algorithm and Splitting Improvements">
  Meet Iris! Our new router exclusive to Jupiter Ultra, designed for better price and routing
  performance.

  * Iris now utilzies better routing algorithms like [Golden-section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-section_search)
    and [Brent's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent%27s_method).
  * Iris allows more granular splitting, **up to 0.01%**,

  We are seeing **100x performance improvements** with these changes compared to our sunsetted Metis router.
</Card>

<Card title="JupiterZ: Growing Volume">
  JupiterZ is our own RFQ engine exclusive to Jupiter Ultra.

  * JupiterZ now facilitates **\~\$100M daily volume** with zero slippage.
  * All of the volume is **executed with zero slippage**.

  We are also working on new improvements for JupiterZ, stay tuned for more updates!
</Card>

***

## Maximising Execution Price and Quality

A problem often overlooked is the lack of comparison between **Executed Price versus Quoted Price**.
When a quote is provided, it does not necessarily represent the actual executable price and quality.

In today's Solana DeFi landscape dominated by Proprietary (Prop) AMMs, these two numbers are increasingly
divergent. Consider this scenario:

| Route                         | Quoted Amount | Executed Amount | Slippage (Amount) | Slippage (%) |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| **Route A (Traditional AMM)** | 100 tokens    | 80 tokens       | 20 tokens         | 20%          |
| **Route B (Prop AMM)**        | 150 tokens    | 50 tokens       | 100 tokens        | 66%          |

Route B shows a 50% better quote, but Route A delivers 60% more tokens to your wallet. This is why
quote comparison between platforms is fundamentally misleading. With Ultra V3, we have made significant
improvements to ensure that the provided quotes reflect actual on-chain execution, not theoretical
best cases or inflated "best prices".

### Ultra Signaling

Ultra V3 introduces **Ultra Signaling**, a mechanism built directly on-chain in our Jupiter Aggregator
Program that allows Prop AMMs to distinguish between different types of user flow when submitting quotes
to Ultra. With Ultra Signaling, Prop AMMs can identify which requests originate from Ultra and are thus
able to differentiate between "non-toxic" and "toxic" order flow when quoting.

* **Non-toxic flow** in this context refers to trades initiated by Ultra that are unlikely to be
  exploited by malicious practices like sandwiching or frontrunning. Since, these trades are seen as
  more "genuine" and less likely to adversely affect the AMM's profit, Prop AMMs are incentivized to
  offer more competitive, tighter pricing to these trades.

* **Toxic flow** typically comes from sources outside of Ultra (as seen from [MEV-Protection](#mev-protection))
  and may include trades that are more susceptible to MEV opportunities. Since these trades carry
  more risk for Prop AMMs, they are generally quoted with wider spreads or less favorable prices.

<Card title="Impact">
  By signaling to Prop AMMs that a user is coming through Ultra (and, therefore, more protected
  from MEV or sandwich attacks), Prop AMMs can confidently provide their best possible quotes
  without the heightened risk associated with toxic order flow. This results in Ultra users
  consistently getting better, more reliable prices compared to other platforms, as the risk profile
  for their transactions is demonstrably lower.

  One of the Prop AMMs we are working with, is now **quoting 3 bps tighter (50% better)** for our Ultra
  users compared to other platforms.
</Card>

### Predictive Execution

Ultra V3 introduces **Predictive Execution** for every route before execution:

1. Aggregated routers return their best quotes.
2. Simulating quotes on-chain to verify actual executable price vs quoted price.
3. Predicting potential slippage for each route, and dynamically prioritizing the route with the
   least overall incurred slippage at the time of execution.

<Card title="Result">
  Since deployment of Predictive Execution in production, we have seen great results in terms of
  slippage protection for our users. Using the volume weighted average of the difference between
  executed slippage and quoted for the past 7 days:

  * Jupiter Ultra provided swaps on average with - **positive slippage of +0.63 bps**.
  * Despite market volatility on 11 Oct 2025, we manage to maintain on average - **above negative
    slippage of -10 bps**

## Sub-Second Transaction Landing

Every block your transaction waits, is an exposure to poorer execution quality, such as market
movement against your position, increased effective slippage, and a higher risk of MEV extraction
opportunities.

**Meet ShadowLane!** Our in-house transaction landing engine - leveraging our own validator stake
and dedicated R\&D efforts from our newly formed RPC team, led by Italo and team members who have
contributed to Yellowstone-gRPC, NFT DAS API, Lite-RPC, Agave, and more.

Thanks to their massive efforts, ShadowLane consistently processes transactions within sub-second
latency and by operating entirely on our own infrastructure instead of relying on external providers,
we eliminate the risk of artificial delays and front-running, ensuring faster and more secure execution
for our users.

### Transaction Landing Latency

<Card title="Result: 50-66% Faster Transaction Landing">
  Transaction landing latency has improved by 50-66% compared with our previous approach that
  relied on multiple providers.

  | Method                  | Blocks     | Latency         |
  | ----------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
  | **ShadowLane**          | 0-1 block  | \~ 50ms - 400ms |
  | **Traditional methods** | 1-3 blocks | \~ 400ms - 1.2s |
</Card>

### MEV Protection

When using other providers, there is always a risk of front-running and sandwich attacks - as the trades
may be sold to third-party MEV searchers.

Ultra V3 does the opposite. Since we are using our own infrastructure to send transactions via ShadowLane,
we are able to minimize the exposure to susceptible MEV risks by ensuring trades are never handed off to
any external providers for on-chain execution.

<Note>
  The risk is not zero as validators still broadcast to the leader, but Ultra brings it as close to zero
  as possible.

  Jupiter Ultra's swap volume to value extracted ratio is significantly lower than others despite
  higher volume, demonstrating the effectiveness of our efforts to bring the best execution quality
  to our users.

  By comparing Jupiter Ultra's volume to value extracted ratio to other top trading terminals,
  we are able to see that Jupiter Ultra is 34x better than the top trading terminals.

## Real-Time Slippage Estimator

Setting the right slippage can be tricky — whether you're dealing with volatile tokens,
stablecoins, or large caps, it's never a one-size-fits-all scenario. This uncertainty
impacts everyone, from newcomers in DeFi to seasoned traders.

Since the inception of RTSE (Real-Time Slippage Estimator), we have been monitoring
real-time market data and transactions, and applying token-specific heuristics and
algorithms to improve the slippage protection for our users. With Ultra V3, we have made
strides by implementing the following improvements:

* **Tighter RTSE slippage heuristics** while maintaining high success rates and reduce overpaying.
* **Automatic prioritization** of slippage-protected routes over purely price-optimized routes.
* **Increased volatility sensitivity** for tokens with high historical volatility patterns.

## Gasless Support Coverage

With Gasless Support acting as a just-in-time fee payer, you can make trades without holding SOL
to cover gas fees - as long as at least one of the tokens in your trade meets the minimum value
requirement, Ultra automatically calculates and covers the gas fee, deducting it from the swap amount.

With Ultra V3, we have expanded gasless support coverage:

* Token2022 tokens
* Memecoin-to-memecoin swaps (when liquidity permits)
* Reduced minimum trade size to \~\$10 USD

Gasless Support will continue to improve over time.

<Note>
  JupiterZ by default is gasless, as the market maker is the fee payer for the transaction!
</Note>

## Just-In-Time Market Revival

Ultra V3 solves a long-standing technical limitation which is to provide routes for tokens that
have "fallen out of favor" - When markets have low liquidity or yet to graduate for a long time,
we downgrade these markets to optimize resource allocation. This makes them unroutable, preventing
users to enter or exit their positions.

To address this, we have implemented a Just-In-Time market Revival Mechanism that **dynamically
re-indexes token markets on-demand**.

<Card title="Impact">
  * Routes virtually any token on Solana, including extremely long-tail assets.
  * Supports old, inactive tokens that historically failed to route.
  * Essentially, no minimum liquidity threshold for token eligibility.
</Card>

## Pre-Graduation Routing Latency Reduction

By default, for all swap pairs, Jupiter Ultra checks for multiple route paths to get the best
price and execution quality. This adds to quote latency.

To further enhance the trading experience for trenchers, we have optimized the routing logic for
all pre-graduated bonding curve markets when applicable.

* When the swap pair involves a pre-graduated token and SOL or USDC.
* We skip multi-route aggregation and look for the direct route immediately.

<Card title="Result">
  Pre-graduated bonding curve markets routing latency has been **reduced by 90%+**.

  |        | Average Quote Latency | Routing Method                          |
  | ------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
  | Before | 200ms                 | Checking multiple potential routes      |
  | After  | 10-15ms               | Direct routing to pre-graduated markets |
</Card>

## Legacy Jupiter Swap

As part of this upgrade, moving forward, we will be focusing our efforts on the ongoing development
and improvement of Ultra V3 with our new router, Iris. We are also rolling out the Ultra API to allow
our partners to utilize the best-in-class routing, execution and transaction landing infrastructure
behind Ultra V3.

Currently, many meta aggregation platforms and others are still using our sunsetted Jupiter Legacy API (Metis)
or deprecated Self-hosted Legacy Swap API binary. We will be working with them to upgrade their routing to
adopt the new Ultra API.

If you are using Jupiter Legacy API in your app, please correctly label to avoid misleading your users that
this is the best price from Jupiter. In particular, certain apps are using the free binary, which is deprecated
and we have no control over the results, and it is very discouraging to see certain platforms abuse something that
we have offered to the ecosystem for free for years.

## Summary

Ultra is more than just a swap - it's an abstraction layer over the challenges of execution and
blockchain complexity:

**For end users:** No need to understand slippage settings, gas fees, RPC selection, or MEV
protection. Ultra handles everything.

**For developers:** The exact same Ultra infrastructure that powers jup.ag's UI is also available
to developers via API. No need to build, host, or maintain your own RPC, transaction landing
infrastructure and manage other trading optimizations. For more information, please refer to
the [Ultra Swap Docs](/docs/ultra).

<Note>
  All of the improvements mentioned in this blog post are exclusive to Ultra only.\
  They are not present in Legacy Swap API.
</Note>

Ultra V3 demonstrates that the best execution isn't about finding the best quote - it's about
delivering the best outcome. Through rigorous measurement, continuous optimization, and proprietary
infrastructure, we've built a system that consistently outperforms on the metrics that actually
matter - the data speaks for itself.

Just use Jupiter.

  <Accordion title="RPC">
    **Set up RPC**

    <Info>
      **NOTE**

      Solana provides a [default RPC endpoint](https://solana.com/docs/core/clusters). However, as your application grows, we recommend you to always use your own or provision a 3rd party provider’s RPC endpoint such as [Helius](https://helius.dev/) or [Triton](https://triton.one/).
    </Info>

    ```js  theme={null}
    import { Connection } from "@solana/web3.js";

    const connection = new Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wallet">
    **Set up Development Wallet**

    <Info>
      **NOTE**

      * You can paste in your private key for testing purposes but this is not recommended for production applications.
      * If you want to store your private key in the project directly, you can do it via a `.env` file.

      To set up a development wallet via `.env` file, you can use the following script.
    </Info>

    ```js  theme={null}
    // index.js
    import { Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
    import dotenv from 'dotenv';
    require('dotenv').config();

    const wallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(bs58.decode(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY || ''));
    ```

    ```bash  theme={null}
    # .env
    PRIVATE_KEY=""
    ```

    To set up a development wallet via a wallet generated via [Solana CLI](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation#solana-cli-basics), you can use the following script.

    ```js  theme={null}
    import { Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
    import fs from 'fs';

    const privateKeyArray = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/Path/To/.config/solana/id.json', 'utf8').trim());

## Build Your Own Transaction

The Lend API provides 2 ways to interface with the Earn functions in the Jupiter Lend Program. You can either make a post request to directly get the **Transaction**, or **Instruction** which can be used for CPI or composing with additional instructions.

### Transaction

To use the Transaction method, simply request to the endpoints without `-instructions` suffix directly, as shown in the examples above. The API will respond with an unsigned base64 transaction for the signer to sign, then sent to the network for execution.

### Instruction

In some use cases, you'd prefer to utilize the instructions instead of the serialized transaction, so you can utilize with CPI or compose with other instructions. You can make a post request to `-instructions`endpoints instead.

<Accordion title="Building with Instuctions Code Snippet">

# About Lend
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/lend/index

Overview of Jupiter Lend and its features.

The Jupiter Lend API is built on top of Jupiter Lend Program.

## About Earn

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the Jupiter Earn Protocol?">
    The Earn Protocol is the 'Deposit and Earn' side of Jupiter Lend. Simply deposit assets to the Jupiter Earn and earn yield.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is this separate from borrowing?">
    Jupiter Lend uses a unified liquidity layer where both Earn (lending) and Borrow (vault) protocol can source liquidity from. For depositors this means you earn the best possible rate at all times without having to migrate your funds when new protocols are launched on Jupiter Lend. You can supply once and earn the most up to date yield from the Jupiter Lend protocol.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there supply or withdraw limits?">
    There is no limits on supplying funds to the Earn Protocol. Withdrawals from Jupiter Lend utilize an Automated Debt Ceiling. Withdrawals increase every block creating a smoothing curve for withdrawals preventing any sudden large movements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the risk?">
    Jupiter Lend is a novel protocol and like all DeFi protocols contains smart contract risk, market risk and other factors which can cause loss of user funds.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the fees for the Earn Protocol?">
    There are no fees to use the Earn Protocol on Jupiter Lend.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## About Borrow

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Jupiter Borrow Protocol?">
    Borrow Vaults are a known standard mechanism for locking collateral and borrowing debt. Jupiter Lend utilizes this familiar single asset - single debt vault approach. Jupiter Lend takes borrow vaults to the next level by being the most capital efficient and optimized protocol enabling up to 95% LTV on collateral.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Jupiter Lend achieve such high LTV?">
    Jupiter borrow vaults has the most advanced liquidation mechanisms, and are able to provide the highest LTVs in the market, the protocol easily removes bad debt and enables the most gas efficient liquidation mechanism in DeFi.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I am liquidated?">
    When your NFT or position is liquidated, a portion of your collateral is sold to repay your debt and return your position to a safe state. In addition to selling a part of your collateral, a liquidation penalty is also charged.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the Max Liquidation Threshold?">
    While the Liquidation Threshold determines when a vault can be liquidated, the protocol also has a 'hard' ceiling for liquidation. When a vault passes the max liquidation threshold it is entirely (100%) liquidated automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My vault passed the liquidation threshold but is not liquidated, will I be liquidated?">
    **Yes your position is still at risk of being liquidated!** Once your position passes the threshold it can be liquidated, but it may not happen immediately. If your position is still at risk you can take the time now to unwind/reduce your risk ratio to make your position safe and prevent a liquidation event.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

# Liquidation
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/lend/liquidation

Walkthrough on building a liquidation bot with Jupiter Lend.

Jupiter Lend allows anyone to participate in the liquidation mechanism. In this section, we have included a minimal Typescript example to get you started.

## Prerequisites

The liquidation bot requires the Jupiter Lend SDK. [You can find the full example at the end of this section](#full-example).

<Note>
  We will be using functions from `@jup-ag/lend/borrow` and `/flashloan`.
</Note>

```bash  theme={null}
npm install @jup-ag/lend
```

<Tip>
  You will also need reliable RPC to fetch information like liquidations or swap quote and to execute the liquidation.
</Tip>

## Breakdown

The liquidation bot requires the following steps:

1. Fetch all available liquidations
2. Flash borrow the debt amount
3. Get liquidation instructions
4. Get Jupiter swap quote (collateral token -> debt token)
5. Get Jupiter swap instructions
6. Build all instructions together
7. Execute the liquidation
8. Flash payback the debt amount

### Fetch liquidations

By using the SDK, you can fetch for all available liquidations.

```typescript  theme={null}
const fetchAllLiquidations = await getAllLiquidations({
  connection,
  signer,
});
```

<Tip>
  **RPC Rate Limit**

  The `getAllLiquidations` function gives you the available liquidations across all vault, each request is processed in parallel, and each consumes \~10 RPC requests.

  If you receive **`429`** or rate limit error code from this function, it is likely due to your RPC connection getting rate limited. You should upgrade your RPC plan to avoid this issue.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Fetch liquidations for specific vault**

  If you'd like to fetch liquidations for a specific vault, you can use the `getLiquidations` function.

  ```typescript  theme={null}
  const fetchLiquidationsByVaultId = await getLiquidations({
    vaultId,
    connection,
    signer,
  });
  ```
</Tip>

### Flash borrow and payback

By using the SDK, you can flashloan to borrow the debt amount and flash payback what you flash borrowed.

```typescript  theme={null}
const fetchFlashBorrowIx = await getFlashBorrowIx({
  amount: debtAmount,
  asset: borrowToken,
  signer,
  connection,
});
```

```typescript  theme={null}
const fetchFlashPaybackIx = await getFlashPaybackIx({
  amount: debtAmount,
  asset: borrowToken,
  signer,
  connection,
});
```

<Tip>
  **ALL flashloans are free**!
</Tip>

### Get liquidation instructions

By using the SDK, you can get the liquidation instructions.

```typescript  theme={null}
const fetchLiquidateIx = await getLiquidateIx({
  vaultId,
  debtAmount,
  signer,
  connection,
});
```

### Get Jupiter quote and swap instructions

For this step, you will need to request to the Jupiter Swap API to get the quote and swap instructions.

* [You can refer to the example below to check how to fetch from the Swap API](#full-example)
* Else, [for the full guide on Swap API, please refer to Swap API section](/docs/swap).

# Oracles
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/lend/oracles

Overview of Jupiter Lend Oracles.

The Oracle Program delivers accurate price data to the protocol by integrating with trusted oracle providers. It calculates exchange rates by combining multiple price sources in a structured sequence, ensuring reliable asset valuations.

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  The Oracle program has been audited by Zenith and Offside.

  **Oracle Program Address:** `jupnw4B6Eqs7ft6rxpzYLJZYSnrpRgPcr589n5Kv4oc`
</Info>

## Hop-Based Oracle System

The system computes exchange rates by processing prices from up to four sources in a sequential chain. Each source contributes to the final rate through multiplication or division, with the option to invert values as needed. Currently, Pyth is the supported source type.

For example, to derive the JUPSOL/SOL rate, the system combines JUPSOL/USD and SOL/USD feeds, inverting the latter to obtain USD/SOL, resulting in an accurate exchange rate.

This design enables the system to:

* Aggregate rates from multiple feeds, reducing dependency on any single provider
* Adjust for varying units or scales using predefined multipliers and divisors
* Validate data integrity at each step

## Freshness Enforcement

To ensure prices reflect current market conditions, the system enforces strict time-based validity checks:

* **User Operations**: Prices must be no older than 60 seconds to be considered valid for actions like borrowing or supplying assets
* **Liquidations**: Prices can be up to 1800 seconds (30 minutes) old, allowing liquidations to proceed during temporary oracle delays while avoiding reliance on outdated data

These checks prevent the protocol from using stale prices for liquidation or health factor calculations.

## Confidence Interval Validation

The system evaluates the confidence interval provided by Pyth price feeds to ensure data reliability:

* **User Operations**: The confidence interval must be within 2% of the reported price
* **Liquidations**: The confidence interval must be within 4% of the reported price

If a price feed's confidence exceeds these thresholds, it is rejected.

## Providers

The program currently utilizes Pyth push feeds for price data. Integration with Chainlink streams is underway to broaden the range of sources.

## Oracle Verification Script

Use this script to verify oracle prices by providing a nonce:

```typescript  theme={null}
import { Program, AnchorProvider } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Connection, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";
import axios from "axios";

const NONCE = 2; // Change this to test different oracles
const ORACLE_PROGRAM_ID = new PublicKey("jupnw4B6Eqs7ft6rxpzYLJZYSnrpRgPcr589n5Kv4oc");
const IDL_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jup-ag/jupiter-lend/refs/heads/main/target/idl/oracle.json";
const RPC_URL = "<RPC URL>";

class OracleReader {
  private program: Program;

  private constructor(program: Program) {
    this.program = program;
  }

  static async create(): Promise<OracleReader> {
    const connection = new Connection(RPC_URL);
    const response = await axios.get(IDL_URL);
    const idl = response.data;

    const wallet = {
      signTransaction: () => { throw new Error("Read-only"); },
      signAllTransactions: () => { throw new Error("Read-only"); },
      publicKey: new PublicKey("11111111111111111111111111111111"),
    };

    const provider = new AnchorProvider(connection, wallet, {});
    const program = new Program(idl, provider);
    return new OracleReader(program);
  }

  private findOraclePDA(nonce: number): PublicKey {
    const [pda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
      [
        Buffer.from("oracle"),
        Buffer.from(new Uint8Array(new Uint16Array([nonce]).buffer)),
      ],
      ORACLE_PROGRAM_ID
    );
    return pda;
  }

  async getPrice(nonce: number) {
    const oraclePDA = this.findOraclePDA(nonce);
    const oracleAccount = await this.program.account.oracle.fetch(oraclePDA);
    
    const remainingAccounts = oracleAccount.sources.map((source: any) => ({
      pubkey: source.source,
      isWritable: false,
      isSigner: false,
    }));

    const price = await this.program.methods
      .getExchangeRateOperate(nonce)
      .accounts({ oracle: oraclePDA })
      .remainingAccounts(remainingAccounts)
      .view();

    return {
      nonce,
      oraclePDA: oraclePDA.toString(),
      price: price.toString(),
      sources: oracleAccount.sources.length
    };

# Lend SDK
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/lend/sdk

Walkthrough on integrating via the Jupiter Lend SDK.

The Jupiter Lend SDK provides a TypeScript interface for interacting with the Jupiter lending protocol. This documentation covers two main integration approaches: getting instruction objects for direct use and getting account contexts for Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) integrations.

## Installation

```bash  theme={null}
npm install @jup-ag/lend
```

## Setup

```typescript  theme={null}
import {
    Connection,
    Keypair, 
    PublicKey, 
    TransactionMessage, 
    TransactionInstruction, 
    VersionedTransaction
} from "@solana/web3.js";
import {
  getDepositIx, getWithdrawIx, // get instructions
  getDepositContext, getWithdrawContext, // get context accounts for CPI
} from "@jup-ag/lend/earn";
import { BN } from "bn.js";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
const signer = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(privateKey));

// Example asset mints
const usdc = new PublicKey("EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v"); // USDC mainnet
```

***

## Instruction

### Get Deposit Instruction

```typescript  theme={null}
const depositIx = await getDepositIx({
    amount: new BN(1000000), // amount in token decimals (1 USDC)
    asset: new PublicKey("EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v"), // asset mint address
    signer: signer.publicKey, // signer public key
    connection, // Solana connection
    cluster: "mainnet",
});
```

### Get Withdraw Instruction

```typescript  theme={null}
const withdrawIx = await getWithdrawIx({
    amount: new BN(1000000), // amount in token decimals (1 USDC)
    asset: new PublicKey("EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v"), // asset mint address
    signer: signer.publicKey, // signer public key
    connection, // Solana connection
    cluster: "mainnet",
});
```

### Example Instruction Usage

```typescript  theme={null}
import {
    Connection,
    Keypair, 
    PublicKey, 
    TransactionMessage, 
    Transaction,
    TransactionInstruction,
    VersionedTransaction
} from "@solana/web3.js";
import {
    getDepositIx,
} from "@jup-ag/lend/earn";
import { BN } from "bn.js";

const signer = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(privateKey));
const connection = new Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');

// Get deposit instruction
const depositIx = await getDepositIx({
    amount: new BN(1000000), // amount in token decimals (1 USDC)
    asset: new PublicKey("EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v"), // asset mint address
    signer: signer.publicKey, // signer public key
    connection, // Solana connection
    cluster: "mainnet",
});

// Convert the raw instruction to TransactionInstruction
const instruction = new TransactionInstruction({
    programId: new PublicKey(depositIx.programId),
    keys: depositIx.keys.map((key) => ({
        pubkey: new PublicKey(key.pubkey),
        isSigner: key.isSigner,
        isWritable: key.isWritable,
    })),
    data: Buffer.from(depositIx.data),
});

const latestBlockhash = await connection.getLatestBlockhash();
const messageV0 = new TransactionMessage({
    payerKey: signer.publicKey,
    recentBlockhash: latestBlockhash.blockhash,
    instructions: [instruction],
}).compileToV0Message();

const transaction = new VersionedTransaction(messageV0);
transaction.sign([signer]);
const serializedTransaction = transaction.serialize();
const blockhashInfo = await connection.getLatestBlockhashAndContext({ commitment: "finalized" });

const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(serializedTransaction);
console.log(`https://solscan.io/tx/${signature}`);
```

## CPI

For Anchor programs that need to make CPI calls to Jupiter Lend, use the context methods.

### Deposit Context Accounts

```typescript  theme={null}
const depositContext = await getDepositContext({
    asset: new PublicKey("EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v"), // asset mint address
    signer: signer.publicKey, // signer public key
    connection,
});
```

<Note>
  The `getLendingTokens` function returns an array of `PublicKey` objects.
</Note>

```typescript  theme={null}
import { getLendingTokens } from "@jup-ag/lend/earn";

const allTokens = await getLendingTokens({ connection });
```

```typescript  theme={null}
[
    PublicKey,
    PublicKey,
    ...
]
```

### Get Token Details

Fetches detailed information about a specific lending token.

```typescript  theme={null}

const tokenDetails = await getLendingTokenDetails({
    lendingToken: new PublicKey("9BEcn9aPEmhSPbPQeFGjidRiEKki46fVQDyPpSQXPA2D"), // allTokens[x] from the previous example
    connection,
});
```

```typescript  theme={null}
{
  id: number; // ID of jlToken, starts from 1
  address: PublicKey; // Address of jlToken
  asset: PublicKey; // Address of underlying asset
  decimals: number; // Decimals of asset (same as jlToken decimals)
  totalAssets: BN; // Total underlying assets in the pool
  totalSupply: BN; // Total shares supply
  convertToShares: BN; // Multiplier to convert assets to shares
  convertToAssets: BN; // Multiplier to convert shares to assets
  rewardsRate: BN; // Rewards rate (1e4 decimals, 1e4 = 100%)
  supplyRate: BN; // Supply APY rate (1e4 decimals, 1e4 = 100%)
}
```

### Get User Position

Retrieves a user's lending position for a specific asset:

```typescript  theme={null}

const userPosition = await getUserLendingPositionByAsset({
    asset: new PublicKey("EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v"), // The address of underlying asset or tokenDetails.asset
    user: signer.publicKey, // User's wallet address
    connection,
});
```

| `cumulativeInterestRate` | **Type:** `u128` <br /><br /> Traders are required to pay hourly borrow fees for opening leveraged positions. This fee is calculated based on two primary factors: the size of the trader's position and the current utilization of the pool for the custody. <br /><br /> To calculate borrow fees more efficiently, each custody account contains a value called `cumulativeInterestRate`. <br /><br /> Correspondingly, each position account stores a `cumulativeInterestSnapshot` which captures the value of `cumulativeInterestRate` at the time of the position's last update. Whenever there's a change in either the borrowed assets or the total assets within a custody, the `cumulativeInterestRate` for the custody is updated. The difference between the custody's `cumulativeInterestRate` and the position's `cumulativeInterestSnapshot` is then used to calculate the position's borrow fees. |
| `lastUpdate`             | **Type:** `i64` <br /><br /> The UNIX timestamp for when the custody's borrow fee data was last updated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `hourlyFundingDbps`      | **Type:** `u64` <br /><br /> A constant used to calculate the hourly borrow fees for the custody. The Jupiter Perpetuals exchange works with Gauntlet and Chaos Labs to update and fine tune the `hourlyFundingDbps` to respond to traders' feedback and market conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `maxAumUsd`               | **Type:** `u128` <br /><br /> The max AUM for the JLP pool. This acts as a max cap / ceiling as the JLP will not accept deposits when the cap is hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `tokenWeightageBufferBps` | **Type:** `u128` <br /><br /> The token weightage buffer (in basis points) to calculate the token's maximum or minimum current weightage based on the target weightage. <br /><br /> Currently, `tokenWeightageBufferBps` is set to `2000` which means the the current weightage cannot be lower or higher than + / - 20% of the token's target weightage. <br /><br /> For example, if SOL's target weightage for the JLP pool is 50%, the current weightage cannot be less than 40% or exceed 60%. The pool will not allow deposits or withdrawals if the action causes the token to exceed its target weightage. |
| `maxPositionUsd`          | **Type:** `u64` <br /><br /> Sets the maximum position size. The current `maxPositionUsd` value is `2_500_000_000_000` which means a position's max size is \$2,500,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `addRemoveLiquidityBps` | **Type:** `u128` <br /><br /> Fee charged when adding or removing liquidity to/from the pool.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `swapBps`               | **Type:** `Limit` <br /><br /> Swap fee for exchanging non-stablecoin tokens routed through the liquidity pool. `swap fee = swapBps ± swapTaxBps`                                                                                                                          |
| `taxBps`                | **Type:** `PoolApr` <br /><br /> Tax fee for non-stablecoins, determined based on the difference between the current and target weightage. A larger difference results in a higher tax fee, encouraging liquidity providers to rebalance the pool to the target weightage. |
| `stableSwapBps`         | **Type:** `Limit` <br /><br /> Swap fee for exchanges involving stablecoins, routed through the liquidity pool. `swap fee = stableSwapBps ± stableSwapTaxBps`                                                                                                              |
| `stableSwapTaxBps`      | **Type:** `Fees` <br /><br /> Tax fee for stablecoin swaps. Similar to taxBps, this fee is determined by the difference between the current and target weightage.                                                                                                          |
| `protocolShareBps`      | **Type:** `PoolApr` <br /><br /> Jupiter takes a share of 2500 BPS (25%) from the fees collected by the pool.                                                                                                                                                              |

| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lastUpdated`    | **Type:** `i64` <br /><br /> The UNIX timestamp when the pool's APR data was last updated.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `feeAprBps`      | **Type:** `u64` <br /><br /> The pool's APR in BPS format. The APR is calculated weekly by dividing the pool's realized fees (minus the 25% collected by the protocol) by the total pool value, adjusting for the 1 week time period to annualize the rate.                                     |
| `realizedFeeUsd` | **Type:** `u64` <br /><br /> The fees collected by the pool so far. This fee is reinvested back into the pool and is also used to calculate the APR as mentioned above. realizedFeeUsd resets to zero when the fee is reinvested into the pool hence causing the APR value to fluctuate weekly. |


# Position Account
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/perps/position-account



This page contains an overview of the  used in the Jupiter Perpetuals Program, and specifically the  account.

The `Position` account is a struct which represents a set of parameters and states associated to trade position data for a given token.

<Info>
  **`Position` account derivation**

  The `Position` account's address is derived from the trader's wallet address / public key, the custody account, the collateral custody account, and a few other constant seeds. This means traders will always have the same Position account address for their open positions.

  This also means that traders only have nine positions available at one time:

  * Long SOL
  * Long wETH
  * Long wBTC
  * Short SOL (USDC as collateral)
  * Short SOL (USDT as collateral)
  * Short wETH (USDC as collateral)
  * Short wETH (USDT as collateral)
  * Short wBTC (USDC as collateral)
  * Short wBTC (USDT as collateral)

  This is an example [`Position` account](https://solscan.io/account/FBLzd5VM67MEKkoWerXu7Nu1ksbLXQvJDx63y5aeLEvt).

# PositionRequest Account
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/perps/position-request-account



This page contains an overview of the  used in the Jupiter Perpetuals Program, and specifically the  account.

The `PositionRequest` account is a struct which represents a set of parameters and states associated to a request to open or close a position, the `PositionRequest` account consists of mostly similar properties as [`Position` account](/docs/perps/position-account).

<Info>
  **`PositionRequest` ACCOUNT DERIVATION**

  It is a Program-Derived Address (PDA) derived from the underlying `Position` account's address, several constant seeds, and a random integer seed which makes each `PositionRequest` account unique.

  The is an example [`PositionRequest` account](https://solscan.io/account/DNnX2B1oiYqKLrbLLod1guuaZA28DQwJ8HuHsgDafoQK).
</Info>

<Note>
  **`PositionRequestATA` ACCOUNT**

  A `PositionRequestATA` account is created for each `PositionRequest` account.

  The `PositionRequestATA` account is an [associated token account](https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account) derived from the `PositionRequest` that contains the tokens from the trader's deposits or withdrawals from withdrawing collateral or closing positions.

  The tokens are then transferred to the position token's custody token account or returned to the trader's wallet when the `PositionRequestATA` account is closed.
</Note>

<Note>
  **TAKE PROFIT / STOP LOSS REQUESTS**

  `PositionRequest` accounts for non TP / SL requests are closed as soon as the request is executed or rejected.

  TP / SL requests are also stored onchain via `PositionRequest` accounts. However, they will only be closed when the TP / SL request is triggered and executed.

  Active TP / SL requests can be fetched onchain (through blockchain explorers like Solscan or SolanaFM) by searching for the `PositionRequest` address or public key associated with the TP / SL request.
</Note>

  **EXAMPLE TYPESCRIPT REPOSITORY**

  This [repository](https://github.com/julianfssen/jupiter-perps-anchor-idl-parsing) contains Typescript code samples on interacting with the Jupiter Perpetuals program IDL with `anchor` and `@solana/web3.js`

  You can also find the [Custody Account fields in the repository](https://github.com/julianfssen/jupiter-perps-anchor-idl-parsing/blob/1a0b5dc71081958895691047a9aa8ba51d2a8765/src/idl/jupiter-perpetuals-idl.ts#L2583) or on a [blockchain explorer](https://solscan.io/account/PERPHjGBqRHArX4DySjwM6UJHiR3sWAatqfdBS2qQJu#anchorProgramIdl).

| `collateralCustody`     | **Type:** `publicKey` <br /><br /> The public key of the position's collateral custody account. <br /><br /> Like the `custody` account, a `collateralCustody` account contains information for the token that's used as collateral for the position (SOL / wETH / wBTC for long positions, USDC / USDT for short positions). The borrow rates for the position will also be calculated based on the position's `collateralCustody`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `mint`                  | **Type:** `publicKey` <br /><br /> For opening positions and collateral deposits, mint refers to the input mint requested by the trader. <br /><br /> For example, if a trader opens a position by providing the initial margin with SOL, then mint will be equal to SOL's mint address. If the trader deposits collateral in USDC, then mint will be equal to USDC's mint address. <br /><br /> For closing positions and collateral withdrawals, mint is equal the to position collateral token's mint address. For example, if a trader closes a long SOL position, mint will be equal to SOL's mint address. If a trader closes a short SOL position, mint is equal to USDC or USDT's mint address depending on the position's collateral. |
| `openTime`              | **Type:** `i64` <br /><br /> The time when the request of position is created in UNIX timestamp format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `sizeUsdDelta`          | **Type:** `u64` <br /> <br />The USD amount to increase or decrease the position size by. The amount is an integer in the atomic value (before decimals which is 6 for USDC / UST mints). <br /> <br />For example, a position request to increase an open position's size by 10 USDC will have a `sizeUsdDelta = 10000000`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `collateralDelta`       | **Type:** `u64` <br /><br /> For opening positions and collateral deposits, `collateralDelta` is the token amount to increase or decrease the position collateral size by. The token amount is represented in atomic values (before decimals).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `requestChange`         | **Type:** `RequestChange` <br /> <br />`requestChange` will be equal to `Increase` for open position and collateral deposit requests, and `Decrease` for close position and collateral withdrawal requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `triggerAboveThreshold` | **Type:** `bool`<br /><br /> When `triggerAboveThreshold` is true, the TP / SL position request will be triggered when the position's token price is greater than or equal to `triggerPrice`. When `triggerAboveThreshold` is false, the TP / SL position request will be triggered when the position's token price is less than or equal to `triggerPrice`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `entirePosition`        | **Type:** `bool` <br /><br /> This attribute is only checked when closing or decreasing position sizes. When `entirePosition` is true, the entire position will be closed (i.e. a close position request). When `entirePosition` is false, the position size will be reduced according to sizeUsdDelta.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

# About Price
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/price/index



The Jupiter Price API aims to be the source of truth of token prices across all Jupiter UIs and integrator platforms, providing a seamless experience for developers and a reliable and accurate price source for users.

<Warning>
  **DEPRECATED**

  [Price API V2](/docs/price/v2) will be/is deprecated by 1 August 2025.

  Please migrate to [Price API V3](/docs/price/v3) which consists of breaking changes.
</Warning>

## Challenges

Accurately pricing tokens on-chain is deceptively complex. Unlike traditional markets with centralized pricing mechanisms and consistent liquidity, decentralized finance (DeFi) presents a set of dynamic and often adversarial conditions. The Price API V3 is built with these realities in mind, abstracting away challenges to deliver accurate, real-time token prices with integrity and consistency.

| Challenge                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gamification of Price**                                      | In decentralized environments, token prices can be manipulated or "gamed" for appearances or exploitative purposes. Common patterns include: <br /> \* Wash trading to inflate volume or imply activity <br /> \* Circular swaps to fabricate higher valuations |
| **Fragmented, Volatile or Imbalanced Liquidity Across Venues** | Liquidity on Solana (and other chains) is spread across numerous protocols and AMMs. No single source can represent the entire market. Different pools might have wildly different pricing and can change very quickly.                                         |
| **Low Liquidity Tokens**                                       | Some tokens trade rarely or only within shallow pools. In such cases, even small orders can cause large price swings, making pricing unreliable.                                                                                                                |

## How Price is Derived

The latest version of Price API is V3 - which uses the **last swapped price (across all transactions)**. The swaps are priced by working outwards from a small set of reliable tokens (like SOL) whose price we get from external oracle sources.

While and also after deriving the last swap price, we also utilize a number of heuristics to ensure the accuracy of the price and eliminate any outliers:

* Asset origin and launch method
* Market liquidity metrics
* Market behaviour patterns
* Holder distribution statistics
* Trading activity indicators
* Market value to liquidity ratios

:::caution
When using Price API, do note that you may face many tokens where price is not available or returns null.

This is because, we use the aforementioned heuristics to determine the price of a token and if the price is reliable - if certain combinations of these factors indicate potential issues with price reliability or market health, the token will be flagged and not provided a price.

This is to safeguard users and prevent an inaccurate price from being returned.

# Price API V2 (Deprecated)
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/price/v2



Price API V2 aims to enhance accuracy by incorporating both **buy** and **sell-side liquidity** to derive the **average price** of the two.

<Warning>
  **DEPRECATED**

  This version of the Price API V2 will be/is deprecated by 30th September 2025.

  Please migrate to [Price API V3](/docs/price/v3) which consists of breaking changes.
</Warning>

This provides more reliable real-time data for SPL tokens. Additionally, V2 provides extra help information like depth and confidence to aid you or your users with decisions.

<TIP>
  **TIP**

  The prices are derived **from Jupiter Swap**, which is an aggregate of most markets on Solana.
</TIP>

## Let’s Get Started

In this guide, we will be going through the simple price responses and the extra help information.

## Get Price (Only Price)

Using the root URL and parameters to pass in, it is as simple as the example code below!

Notice the `ids` parameter with the public key or token address of a token mint, you can also input more than 1 address by comma-separating them.

#### Price vs USDC by default

```js  theme={null}
const priceResponse = await fetch(
    'https://lite-api.jup.ag/price/v2?ids=JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN,So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112'
);

const priceData = await priceResponse.json();

console.log(priceData);
```

#### Price vsToken

```js  theme={null}
console.log(JSON.stringify(priceData, null, 2));

const priceResponseWithVsToken = await fetch(
    'https://lite-api.jup.ag/price/v2?ids=JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN,So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112&vsToken=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112'
);

const priceDataWithVsToken = await priceResponseWithVsToken.json();

console.log(JSON.stringify(priceDataWithVsToken, null, 2));
```

From the above example, you should see this response.

Notice 2 details here:

* Usage of `vsToken`: The first set of data shows price denoted in USDC while the second set of data denotes in the price of SOL.
* With no `showExtraInfo`: There is only 1 price, the derived price is the buy price.

```json expandable theme={null}
{
  "data": {
    "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112": {
      "id": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
      "type": "derivedPrice",
      "price": "210.195311500"
    },
    "JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN": {
      "id": "JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN",
      "type": "derivedPrice",
      "price": "1.084247"
    }
  },
  "timeTaken": 0.00488491
}
{
  "data": {
    "JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN": {
      "id": "JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN",
      "type": "derivedPrice",
      "price": "0.005158283466279884"
    },
    "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112": {
      "id": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
      "type": "derivedPrice",
      "price": "1"
    }
  },
  "timeTaken": 0.00203215
}
```

## Get Price (with Extra Info)

To get extra help information such as confidence level or depth, you will need to pass in `showExtraInfo=true`. However, do note that if this is set to `true`, you will not be able to apply `vsToken`.

```js  theme={null}
const priceResponseShowExtraInfo = await fetch(
    'https://lite-api.jup.ag/price/v2?ids=JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN,So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112&showExtraInfo=true'
);

const priceDataShowExtraInfo = await priceResponseShowExtraInfo.json();

console.log(JSON.stringify(priceDataShowExtraInfo, null, 2));
```

Here is the sample response.

Notice a few details here:

* You can see both last swap and current quote prices.
* You can see both buy and sell prices of the different types.
* You can see the unix timestamps.
* You can see the confidence and depth information.

```json expandable theme={null}
{
  "data": {
    "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112": {

## Limitations

**Query limits**

1. You can query up to 100 `id`s at once.

**If the price for a token cannot be found, it is either because**

1. The token is not tradable on Jupiter - it does not fit Jupiter’s routing criteria.
2. There is no route for this token to SOL.
3. `sellPrice`, `sellAt` & `lastSwappedPrice` might be null in cases
4. If `sellPrice` & `sellAt` is not cached and cannot be retrieved the provided information will be `buyPrice`.
5. `lastSwappedPrice` might be null if the token has not been traded recently or cannot be retrieved.
6. Tokens that have not been traded via USDC in the last 3 days.
7. Note that this is only for swaps done via Jupiter, it will not be done for swaps done e.g. directly on Raydium’s platform

**`buyPriceImpactRatio` & `sellPriceImpactRatio` in the depth field might be null in cases**

1. We are to get the respective price impacts for the 10, 100 and 1000 SOL buys or sells
2. It could be because the token’s liquidity does not have enough liquidity for larger values
3. We cannot find the sell quote for the respective token and the buy/sell values

# Price API V3 (Beta)
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/price/v3



Price API V3 aims to provide a one source of truth across all Jupiter UIs and integrator platforms. The simplified format allows easy integration while letting Jupiter handle the complexity of ensuring the accuracy of the provided prices.

</Note>

## How Price is Derived

Price API V3 price tokens by using the **last swapped price (across all transactions)**. The swaps are priced by working outwards from a small set of reliable tokens (like SOL) whose price we get from external oracle sources.

While and also after deriving the last swap price, we also utilize a number of heuristics to ensure the accuracy of the price and eliminate any outliers:

* Asset origin and launch method
* Market liquidity metrics
* Market behaviour patterns
* Holder distribution statistics
* Trading activity indicators
* [Organic Score](/docs/tokens/organic-score)

## Get Price

Simply request via the base URL with the query parameters of your desired mint addresses. You can also comma-separate them to request for multiple prices.

```js  theme={null}
const price = await (
    await fetch(
        'https://lite-api.jup.ag/price/v3?ids=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112,JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN'
    )
).json();
console.log(JSON.stringify(price, null, 2));
```

## Price Response

Here is the sample response, notice a few details here:

* The `usdPrice` is the only price.
* The `decimals` response is helpful to display price information on the UI.
* The `blockId` can be used to verify the recency of the price.

```js  theme={null}
{
  "JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN": {
    "usdPrice": 0.4056018512541055,
    "blockId": 348004026,
    "decimals": 6,
    "priceChange24h": 0.5292887924920519
  },
  "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112": {
    "usdPrice": 147.4789340738336,
    "blockId": 348004023,
    "decimals": 9,
    "priceChange24h": 1.2907622140620008
  }
}
```

## Limitations

**Query limits**

* You can query up to 50 `ids` at once.

**If the price of a token cannot be found**

* Typically, it is likely that the token has not been traded recently - in the last 7 days.
* Additionally, we also use the aforementioned heuristics to determine the price of a token and if the price is reliable - if certain combinations of these factors indicate potential issues with price reliability or market health, the token will be flagged and not provided a price.
* The token is flagged as suspicious and this can be cross referenced with the Token API V2's `audit.isSus` field.

**V2 had more information**

* Yes V2 had more information, however, we think that it is not the best representation of price and it also caused different interpretations of price across the different platforms.
* With Price API V3, we are handling the complexities to ensure price accuracy and elimate outliers [using the heuristics as mentioned above](#how-price-is-derived), so there will only be one stable and accurate price source for all.
* If you require more information like Price API V2, you can use the `/quote` endpoint of the Swap API to derive those data ([you can refer to this post about how Price API V2 is derived](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/introducing-the-price-v2-api/22175)).

## Cancel Order

If you want to cancel order(s), you need to do these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Get a list of the order accounts you want to cancel via `/getRecurringOrders` endpoint.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Choose the order account to cancel by making a post request to the `/cancelOrder` endpoint to get the transaction to cancel the order.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Sign then send the transaction to the network either via `/execute` endpoint or by yourself.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **GET RECURRING ORDERS**

  [Refer to the `/getRecurringOrders` section](/docs/recurring/get-recurring-orders) to prepare the list of order accounts you want to cancel.
</Note>

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  The `/cancelOrder` endpoint only supports 1 cancellation per transaction.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **CAUTION**

  Price-based orders via API is deprecated.

## Create Order

This is a POST request to `/createOrder` endpoint, where you pass in the necessary parameters and our backend will create the transaction for you to sign and send to the network seamlessly.

<Note>
  **INFO**

  The Recurring API supports both Time-based and Price-based (DEPRECATED) strategies.

  The `createOrder` endpoint is used to create both types of orders based on the parameters you pass in.
</Note>

### Time-based Order

Pass in the **`time`** object in the `params` field.

<Info>
  Some notes to help you understand the parameters.

  * The amount to be spent per cycle is calculated based on your input amount and the total number of orders.

  ```js  theme={null}
  Amount to be spent per cycle = inAmount / numberOfOrders
  e.g. 1_000 USDC / 10 orders = 100 USDC per order
  ```

  * The total time to complete is definite as the amount to be spent per cycle is fixed.

  ```js  theme={null}
  Total time to complete = numberOfOrders * interval
  e.g. 10 orders * 86_400 seconds = 864_000 seconds = 10 days
  ```
</Info>

```js expandable theme={null}
const createOrderResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/recurring/v1/createOrder', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            user: wallet.publicKey,
            inputMint: "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",

            params: {
                time: {
                    inAmount: 104000000, // Raw amount of input token to deposit now (before decimals)
                    numberOfOrders: 2, // Total number of orders to execute
                    interval: 86400, // Time between each order in unix seconds
                    minPrice: null, // Minimum price or null
                    maxPrice: null, // Maximum price or null
                    startAt: null, // Unix timestamp of start time or null - null starts immediately
                },
            },
        }),
    })
).json();
```

### Price-based Order (DEPRECATED)

Pass in the **`price`** object in the `params` field.

<Warning>
  **CAUTION**

  Price-based orders via API is deprecated.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  Some notes to help you understand the parameters.

  * Price-based orders are opened indefinitely until the user closes them.
  * Once low on funds, the order will not be closed and can continue to execute if the user deposits more into the order. Refer to the [Deposit Price Order](/docs/recurring/deposit-price-order) endpoint to deposit more funds into the order.
  * Alternatively, the user can also withdraw funds from the order without closing it. Refer to the [Withdraw Price Order](/docs/recurring/withdraw-price-order) endpoint to withdraw funds from the order.
  * Do note that the price-based orders auto withdraws the output tokens to the user's wallet every time the order is executed.
  * The total time to use up all funds is not definite as the amount to be spent per cycle is variable based on the USDC value of the input token.
</Info>

```js  theme={null}
const createOrderResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/recurring/v1/createOrder', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({

            inputMint: "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
            outputMint: "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
            params: {
                price: {
                    depositAmount: 110000000, // Raw amount of input token to deposit now (before decimals)
                    incrementUsdcValue: 10000000, // Raw amount of USDC to increment per cycle (before decimals)
                    interval: 86400, // Time between each cycle in unix seconds
                    startAt: null, // Unix timestamp of start time or null - null starts immediately
                },
            },
        }),
    })
).json();
```

Now that you have the order transaction, you can sign and send to the network. There are 2 methods, after signing the transaction, you can either send it to the network yourself or use the Recurring API's `/execute` endpoint to do it for you.

## Deposit Order

If you want to deposit funds into a price-based order, you need to do these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Get a list of the order accounts you want to deposit via `/getRecurringOrders` endpoint.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Choose the order account to deposit by making a post request to the `/priceDeposit` endpoint to get the transaction to deposit into the order.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Sign then send the transaction to the network either via `/execute` endpoint or by yourself.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **GET RECURRING ORDERS**

  [Refer to the `/getRecurringOrders` section](/docs/recurring/get-recurring-orders) to prepare the order account you want to deposit into.
</Note>

```js  theme={null}
const priceDepositResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/recurring/v1/priceDeposit', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({

  </CardGroup>
</Note>

After getting the order transaction, you can sign and send to the network yourself or use the Recurring API's `/execute` endpoint to do it for you.

## Sign Transaction

Using the Solana `web3.js` v1 library, you can sign the transaction as follows:

```js  theme={null}
// ... GET /createOrder's response

// Extract the transaction from the order response
const transactionBase64 = createOrderResponse.transaction

// Deserialize the transaction
const transaction = VersionedTransaction.deserialize(Buffer.from(transactionBase64, 'base64'));

// Sign the transaction
transaction.sign([wallet]);

// Serialize the transaction to base64 format
const signedTransaction = Buffer.from(transaction.serialize()).toString('base64');
```

## Execute Order

By making a post request to the `/execute` endpoint, Jupiter executes the order transaction on behalf of you/your users. This includes handling of transaction handling, priority fees, RPC connection, etc.

<Note>
  **INFO**

  Do note that you need both the signed transaction and the order id to execute the order.

  The order id is returned in the [`createOrder` response](/docs/recurring/create-order).
</Note>

```js  theme={null}
const executeResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/recurring/v1/execute', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            signedTransaction: signedTransaction,
            requestId: createOrderResponse.requestId,
        }),
    })
).json();
```

## Execute Order Response

After making the post request to the `/execute` endpoint, you will receive a response with the status of the order.

**Example response of successful order:**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "signature": "...",
  "status": "Success",
  "order": "4DWzP4TdTsuwvYMaMWrRqzya4UTFKFoVjfUWNWh8zhzd",
  "error": null
}
```

**Example response of failed order:**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "signature": "...",
  "status": "Failed",
  "order": null,
  "error": "Insufficient funds for the operation requested.",
}
```

## Send Transaction Yourself

If you want to handle the transaction, you can sign and send the transaction to the network yourself.

```js expandable theme={null}
const transactionBase64 = createOrderResponse.transaction
const transaction = VersionedTransaction.deserialize(Buffer.from(transactionBase64, 'base64'));

transaction.sign([wallet]);

const transactionBinary = transaction.serialize();

const blockhashInfo = await connection.getLatestBlockhashAndContext({ commitment: "finalized" });

const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(transactionBinary, {
    maxRetries: 1,
    skipPreflight: true
});

const confirmation = await connection.confirmTransaction({
signature,
blockhash: blockhashInfo.value.blockhash,
lastValidBlockHeight: blockhashInfo.value.lastValidBlockHeight,
}, "finalized");

if (confirmation.value.err) {
    throw new Error(`Transaction failed: ${JSON.stringify(confirmation.value.err)}\n\nhttps://solscan.io/tx/${signature}`);
} else console.log(`Transaction successful: https://solscan.io/tx/${signature}`);

# Integrate DEX into Metis
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/routing/dex-integration

Walkthrough on how to integrate your decentralized exchanged (DEX) into Metis

upiter is one of the most widely integrated protocols, so a lot of work is involved in minimizing issues on new integrations and making each integration valuable to our users and partners. Our top priority is ensuring security and providing the best prices and the best token selection for our users, so we will focus on DEXes that will bring the most benefits to them.

<Warning>
  **WE DO NOT CHARGE FEES FOR INTEGRATION.**
</Warning>

## Integration Prerequisites

As Solana grows and more DEXes are built, we have to be more cautious in the DEXes we integrate, we look into a variety of factors.

* **Code health**: It will help with integration and ensure maintainability in the future.
* **Security audit**: This is important to ensure users' funds are secure and the program is not malicious.
* **Traction**: We look at the traction of the DEX to ensure it has market demand and is well-used.
* **Team and backers**: This is a good indicator of the quality of the DEX if they are backed by or built by reputable or verifiable entities.

### AMM Interface

To facilitate integration of your DEX into the Jupiter Core Engine:

* Provide a DEX SDK that works with the [Jupiter AMM Interface](https://docs.rs/crate/jupiter-amm-interface).
* Enable us to fork your SDK, this ensures our users that we can guarantee maintenance, support for the SDK, and fix potential bugs related to integrated DEXs.

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  `get_accounts_to_update` provides the necessary accounts to fetch, they are batched and cached by the Jupiter Core Engine and delivered through `update` to the AMM instance, there might be multiple calls to `quote` using the same cache so **we do not allow any network calls** in the entire implementation.
</Info>

<Note>
  **RESOURCE AND SUPPORT**

  You can refer to the implementation guide [https://github.com/jup-ag/rust-amm-implementation](https://github.com/jup-ag/rust-amm-implementation) for easier integration with Jupiter.

## Juno Liquidity Engine

Juno is Jupiter's latest liquidity engine, it is built with the combined learnings from Metis and JupiterZ, with one single objective - to ensure the best possible execution price and success rate across all engines and liquidity sources. Juno employs a sophisticated self-learning mechanism to maintain high availability of competitive routes while automatically sidelining underperforming or potentially problematic quotes. Juno will be incrementally introducing new third-party liquidity sources and a continual effort to improve Metis and JupiterZ routing capabilities.

|                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Multi-liquidity sources**  | Integrates third-party liquidity sources and Jupiter's proprietary routing engines to ensure best possible rates.      Currently, Juno consists of Metis, JupiterZ, Hashflow, DFlow and more in the pipeline.                                                                                                                         |

| **Continuous optimizations** | By integrating external liquidity sources directly, Juno creates a competitive environment that drives continuous improvement across all routing engines. This approach ensures users consistently receive optimal execution rates while providing valuable performance data to enhance both Metis and JupiterZ routing capabilities. |

Juno is directly powering the Ultra Swap on Jupiter frontend (jup.ag) and is also accessible via [**Ultra Swap API**](/docs/ultra): The Jupiter Ultra Swap API is the *only* API you ever need to experience or build the best trading experience on Solana - Jupiter handles all the complexities such as RPCs, slippage, broadcast method and landing rates, all while accessing the best liquidity available through Juno.

## Jupiter Metis Routing Engine

Since its inception in 2023, Jupiter's proprietary DEX aggregation engine, Metis v1, has become a cornerstone of Solana blockchain's DeFi ecosystem. Metis functions as a sophisticated aggregation layer for on-chain liquidity, with one single objective - to algorithmically determine the most efficient trade route for any given token pair, considering factors like price, slippage, and quoted-to-executed price across multiple DEXes and AMMs. This ensures users receive the best possible execution price available on-chain at the moment that they wish to trade.

As of 2025, we've deployed Metis v1.5 which has experimented with modified algorithms to enable more granular splits and allows for a larger set of tokens to act as intermediate tokens in a route. From our analysis so far, this translates to 4.6x less spread between quoted and executed price. This is a continued effort to experiment with better configurations and algorithms to improve Metis.

**Metis v1**

Metis v1's impact extends far beyond simple facilitation of on-chain trades. It is the de-facto liquidity engine on Solana, playing an instrumental role in onboarding millions of users to the network and facilitating trillions of dollars in cumulative trading volume. Its stability and general-purpose design have made it a reliable foundation for countless developers and protocols building on Solana.

Currently, Metis v1 powers the [**Swap API**](/docs/swap): A robust interface designed for developers and applications requiring programmatic access to Solana's liquidity. It currently has tens of thousands of requests per second, with demonstrated capacity to handle peak loads reaching hundreds of thousands of requests per second.

## JupiterZ (RFQ) Routing Engine

Since its launch in 2024, JupiterZ has emerged as a transformative addition to Jupiter's routing capabilities. JupiterZ functions as an RFQ (Request For Quote) system that connects users directly with market makers, enabling market makers to provide competitive quotes for top token pairs. This ensures users receive the best possible execution price available from both on-chain and off-chain liquidity at the moment they wish to trade.

| **Integrating diverse market makers**  | Utilizes a standardized interface to integrate with multiple market makers, abstracting away the complexities of each liquidity provider.                          |
| **Optimizing for price and execution** | Creates a competitive environment where market makers compete to provide the best quotes, while ensuring the transaction is executed successfully and efficiently. |
| **Real-time quote aggregation**        | Employs a versatile proxy to collect and compare quotes from multiple routing sources (such as Jupiter Metis v1 and JupiterZ) in real-time.                        |
| **Gasless transactions**               | Enables users to execute trades without incurring transaction fees, providing a seamless and cost-effective trading experience.                                    |

JupiterZ has been handling a large portion of trades on the Jupiter frontend (jup.ag) - which has demonstrated JupiterZ's reliability and effectiveness in providing competitive quotes and successful trade execution.

Currently, JupiterZ is accessible through the **Ultra Swap API**: A streamlined interface that makes it simple for developers and applications to tap into Metis v1, JupiterZ and other routing sources.

# Market Listing
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/routing/market-listing

Understand how markets are listed and maintained on Jupiter.

## Routing Type

Jupiter Metis creates routes in the perspective of markets and there are 2 types of routing for all markets.

We constantly index for updated market data and newly created markets to check against the rules for market listing to ensure markets are eligible for and remain in the Jupiter Metis routing engine.

<Card title="Instant routing">
  * We automatically list all new markets that are created on specific DEXes (list is below).
  * These markets have a grace period, where the liquidity criteria is not applied.
  * After the grace period has passed, the liquidity criteria will apply (refer to normal routing).
  * For bonding curves, if it does not graduate after the grace period, it will be removed from routing.
    * Only when the bonding curve has graduated to a new market, the graduated market will be added to routing.

  <Accordion title="List of DEXes that are eligible for Instant Routing">
    - Meteora Dynamic Bonding Curve
    - Meteora Dynamic AMM
    - Meteora DAMM V2
    - Meteora DLMM
    - Raydium
    - Raydium CLMM
    - Raydium CPMM
    - Raydium Launchlab
    - Pump.fun AMM
    - Pump.fun
    - Fluxbeam
    - Whirlpool
    - Moonshot
    - Virtuals
    - Boop.fun
  </Accordion>
</Card>

<Card title="Normal routing">
  * This is the default for all markets.
  * Every 30 minutes, we will check the liquidity of the market.
  * If the liquidity is not enough, we will remove the market from routing.
</Card>

## Market Liquidity Requirements

The market must fit one of the following criteria for it to be routable:

1. **Less than 30% price difference on \$500**

Using a benchmark position size of \$500, a user should encounter less than 30% price difference after buying \$500 worth and then selling back on the same market.

Price Difference = (\$500 - Final USD value) / \$500 If the price difference is more than 30%, it means that there is insufficient liquidity in the market for the benchmark position size of \$500.

2. **Less than 20% price impact on market**

If the above (sell back \$500 worth) fails, we will compare the price per token received from buying \$1000 worth vs the price per token received from buying \$500 worth to calculate price impact.

If the price impact is more than 20%, it means that the market is illiquid.

<Tip>
  If you are unsure if your market has passed the liquidity requirement, you can check your pool directly via the UI of the DEX you created the market on.

* [**Troubleshooting**](https://github.com/jup-ag/rfq-webhook-toolkit/tree/main/tests/README.md#troubleshooting): Common issues that arise during integration.

### RFQ API Schema

To facilitate the integration into Jupiter's RFQ module, you will need to provide a webhook for us to register the quotation and swap endpoints with the corresponding request and response format.

| Endpoint | Method | URL                                                | Description                                                                                                   |
| :------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Base URL | -      | `https://your-api-endpoint.com/jupiter/rfq`        | Example URL that we will register into our API.                                                               |
| Quote    | POST   | `https://your-api-endpoint.com/jupiter/rfq/quote`  | Called to request quotes.                                                                                     |
| Swap     | POST   | `https://your-api-endpoint.com/jupiter/rfq/swap`   | Called to execute swaps.                                                                                      |
| Tokens   | GET    | `https://your-api-endpoint.com/jupiter/rfq/tokens` | Called periodically to fetch supported tokens ([see the token section below](#advertising-supported-tokens)). |

<Info>
  **API KEY**

  If you require an API key to access your endpoints, please provide it to us during the registration process. The API Key will be passed to the webhook as a header `X-API-KEY`.
</Info>

### Response Codes

Market Makers should return appropriate HTTP status codes along with error messages.

| Status Code         | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200 OK`            | The request was successful, and the webhook will return a quote.                                                                             |
| `404 Not Found`     | The webhook will not return a quote for this request (e.g. the pair or the size are not supported).                                          |
| `400 Bad Request`   | The request sent to the webhook is malformed (e.g. missing an expected parameter).                                                           |
| `401 Unauthorized`  | Authorization failed. For example the `X-API-KEY` is missing or incorrect.                                                                   |
| `50x Server Errors` | The webhook is offline or unable to respond. If the status persist, the webhook will be temporarily suspended and will not receive requests. |

<Info>
  **TIMEOUTS**

  A webhook must adhere to the [fulfillment and response time requirements](#fulfillment-requirements). When sending the quote request, the RFQ system includes the following headers:

  | <span className="dark:text-white text-black">Header</span> | <span className="dark:text-white text-black">Description</span>    |
  | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `x-request-start`                                          | The millisecond timestamp indicating when the request was sent.    |
  | `x-request-timeout`                                        | The millisecond timeout for the request (currently set to 250 ms). |
</Info>

## Integration Notes

### Order Engine

The RFQ functionality depends on the mainnet deployment of the [Order Engine Program](https://solscan.io/account/61DFfeTKM7trxYcPQCM78bJ794ddZprZpAwAnLiwTpYH) for order fulfillment.

* **Source Code**: The program's source is located in the [programs/order-engine](https://github.com/jup-ag/rfq-webhook-toolkit/tree/main/programs/order-engine) directory.
* **IDL**: The Interface Definition Language (IDL) file is available [here](https://github.com/jup-ag/rfq-webhook-toolkit/tree/main/idls).

### Fulfillment Requirements

To ensure market makers stay competitive and responsive, we enforce a minimum benchmark for fulfillment and response times.

* **Fulfillment**: Market makers are expected to comply and fulfill **95%** of the quotes provided within a 1-hour window. If this is not met, the market maker will be turned off.
* **Response Time**: A webhook must respond within **250 ms** of receiving a quote request. If it fails to do so, the RFQ system will proceed with the available quotes at the time.

<Warning>
  **CAUTION**

  To resume operations, we will need to manually re-enable your webhook, please reach out to us if this happens.
</Warning>

### Expiry

We enforce a fixed expiry timing flow for all quotes and transactions. This simplifies the integration by removing the need for market makers to specify custom expiry times in quote requests, providing consistent behavior across all quotes and transactions, and establishing clear timeout boundaries at different stages of the flow.

**Breakdown of the expiry flow:**

* **Total of 55 seconds**: Transaction expiry time
* **1st 35 seconds**: Reserved for the webhook to verify, sign, and send the transaction on-chain
* **2nd 20 seconds**: Allocated for the user to accept the quote

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  The frontend automatically re-quotes every 3 seconds.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **CAUTION**

  These expiry thresholds may be adjusted based on performance and feedback.
</Warning>

### Fees

Jupiter RFQ allows MMs a way to provide liquidity, adjust their quotes without being subject to the volatility of on-chain gas prices or chain health. RFQ fills are also much less CU intensive (\< 10x) compared to AMM swaps, and can save gas in the long run on fills. Today, RFQ, when operating in Ultra mode, charges a dynamic fee that is selected based on factors like tokens and size.

**Dynamic Fee**

The dynamic fee amount is forwarded to webhooks in the quote request parameters and it is contained in the message that both taker and maker sign ([see the payload section below](#non-standard-payload)). In manual mode, the fee is a flat 2pbs.

**Fee Calculation**

Webhooks do not need to account for fees when quoting, the fee is applied directly by the RFQ system during transaction building.

* For example, for a quote of 1 SOL to 1,000 USDC with a fee of 100 bps
* Only 990 USDC will be transferred out of the market maker account
* While 10 USDC will be collected as a fee

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  The fee is not automatically transferred and will be accounted for asynchronously on a regular basis.

  This is subject to change in the future.
</Info>

### Non-standard payload

The transaction data includes, beside the instruction data for the order-engine, 3 additional bytes that are appended to the instruction data. These bytes are not processed by the program and are only information and to be consumed by an off-chain consumer. The first 2 bytes contains the fee amount in basis points (u16) and the third byte (u8) is a bit mask where the least significant bit indicates if the swap is exact-in (0) or exact-out (1).

### Advertising Supported Tokens

In order to receive relevant quote requests, market makers need to advertise the tokens they support. This is done by providing a list of supported tokens in the response to the `/tokens` route. The response should be a JSON array of token addresses. The list of tokens is refreshed every 10 minutes.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does RFQ support native SOL?">
    Yes, native SOL is fully supported in the order-engine program for both the taker (user) and the maker. However, for now, we assume the maker will use WSOL (Wrapped SOL).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do faster quotes receive priority?">
    No, the RFQ system dispatches the quote request to all registered webhooks simultaneously. All quotes received within the quote timeout are compared to select the best one. The selection prioritizes the quote value first (In the unlikely scenario where two quotes have identical values, the quote from the webhook with the faster response time will be actually prioritized).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Shall a webhook verify swap requests?">
    Yes, the RFQ system will verify the swap requests before forwarding them to the webhooks. However, webhooks are encouraged to verify the swap requests as well to ensure the integrity of the system. The checks that the RFQ system performs can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/jup-ag/rfq-webhook-toolkit/blob/de46a38c3cfbda730c026a9b4bea85591c83f9e5/order-engine-sdk/src/fill.rs#L151" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">validate\_similar\_fill\_sanitized\_message</a> function.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a penalty for not providing a quote (status code 404)?">
    No, there is no penalty. It is up to the webhook to decide whether to respond with a quote (<code>200 OK</code>) or indicate that it cannot provide one (<code>404 Not Found</code>).

    For example, suppose a webhook provides quotes for USDC/SOL only within a range of 100 to 1000 USDC. If it receives a quote request for 10 USDC → SOL, it will respond with <code>404 Not Found</code>, since the amount is outside its quoting range.

    In another case, a webhook may only support one-way quotes (USDC → SOL) but not SOL → USDC. If it receives a request for SOL → USDC, it will also return <code>404 Not Found</code>.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a fee applied to stable-to-stable swaps?">
    No. Stable to stable swaps are exempt from fees.

<Info>
  **API PARAMS**

  * The `amount` is in its atomic value before applying decimals, e.g. 1 USDC is 1\_000\_000.
  * The `mint` defaults to SOL if not provided, if provided it can be any token mint.
</Info>

<Info>
  **SIGNING AND SENDING**

  * After getting the transaction, you need to sign with **both sender and recipient** keypair.
  * You can send the transaction to the network via any method.

# About Send API
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/send/index



Send is the perfect onboarding tool to gift, pay, or onboard anyone in seconds - even if they don't have a wallet.

* Send any token - SOL, USDC or memecoins.
* Send to a new user without a wallet, existing user or anyone.
* No fees to send or claim, only network transaction fees required.
* Use Jupiter Mobile seamlessly - even if you sent non-SOL tokens, Ultra provides Gasless Support that pays for swap transaction fees.

## About

Send API provides more opportunities for potential users to be onboarded from other websites, apps, or any where else!

* API only supports creating Send and Clawback transactions.
* Claiming needs to be done via Jupiter Mobile only.
* You can gamify the experience post-claim once they are onboarded!

## Jupiter Mobile Adapter

To maximize users experience, once your users have claimed via Jupiter Mobile, they can use the app to continue their journey on your app or other use cases. This can be done via [Jupiter Mobile Adapter](/tool-kits/wallet-kit/jupiter-mobile-adapter), allowing Jupiter Mobile users to simply use the app to scan a QR code to login, they can utilize their wallets on Jupiter Mobile across any platform.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How to does claim work?">
    * The invite code can be in the format of a link or a QR code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to claim via API or on my own app?">
    * No, Send claims should be done in Jupiter Mobile.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I get my funds back?">
    * Send is end-to-end self-custodial, where if recipient never claims, the invite code becomes invalid and your tokens are sent back to you upon expiry.
    * Or use the clawback endpoint via the API to create the clawback transaction.

## Security

The Send API is designed for **transaction building only** - it expects and exchanges parameters such as public keys, amounts, and mint addresses. The API **does not handle private keys or invite codes** for security reasons.

**All cryptographic operations must be performed client-side:**

* Invite code generation
* Private key derivation from invite codes
* Transaction signing

The following sections provide the complete implementation steps required before using the API.

<Warning>
  **WARNING**

  **CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS**

  * **Never share invite codes or private keys** - treat them like passwords or seed phrases
  * **Store invite codes securely** - use encrypted storage, secure vaults, or environment variables
  * **Validate all inputs** - ensure invite codes meet expected format before processing
  * **Implement proper error handling** - avoid exposing sensitive data in logs or error messages

  **⚠️ Loss of funds:** Any exposure of invite codes or private keys may result in permanent loss of funds. Jupiter is not liable for losses due to compromised credentials.
</Warning>

## Prerequisite

### Dependencies

```bash  theme={null}
npm install @solana/web3.js@1 # Using v1 of web3.js instead of v2
npm install dotenv # Useful for testing and handling of invite code and private key
npm install @noble/ed25519
npm install @noble/hashes
```

### Imports

Create a utils file to add these functions

```js  theme={null}
import crypto from "crypto";
import * as ed from "@noble/ed25519";
import { sha512 } from "@noble/hashes/sha512";
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

// Configure the ed25519 library to use SHA-512 for internal operations
// This is REQUIRED before using any ed25519 functions like getPublicKey()
// The library needs to know which hash function to use for key derivation and signing
const hashFunction = (...messages) => sha512(ed.etc.concatBytes(...messages));
ed.etc.sha512Sync = hashFunction;

// Import createHash function from Node.js crypto module using dynamic import
// This allows us to use the modern 'node:crypto' protocol for better compatibility
// createHash is used for SHA-256 hashing in the invite code functions
const { createHash } = await import("node:crypto");
```

## Functions

### Create Invite Code

```js  theme={null}
// This function creates a random 12-character base58 invite code
// Uses 13 random bytes (~1.4 quintillion possible codes)

  return binary_to_base58(new Uint8Array(buf)).substring(0, 12);
};
```

### Derive Solana Secret Key

```js  theme={null}
// This function converts an invite code to a deterministic private key
// Uses SHA256 hash of `"invite:"` + `invite_code` as the seed
// Returns a 64-byte Solana secret key (32 bytes private + 32 bytes public key)

    Get pending invites.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Get invite history.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  Both of the following endpoints only returns the invites that are set up by the sender and not from the perspective of the recipient.

  * Pending invites: Invites created by the sender that are not yet expired and can be clawback/claimed.
  * Invite history: Invites created by the sender and is either claimed, clawback, or expired. (You can also pass in a Recipient pubkey to get their history)
</Info>

<Tip>
  **TIP**

  Depending on how you have set up to allow connection of wallets, either via [Jupiter Mobile Adapter](/tool-kits/wallet-kit/jupiter-mobile-adapter) for QR code login, wallet extensions, or any other methods, you will need to handle the passing in of their pubkey to the API to get the necessary data.
</Tip>

      * If you want to store your private key in the project directly, you can do it via a `.env` file.
    </Info>

    To set up a development wallet via `.env` file, you can use the following script.

## Pool Address

Your successfully created token via Jupiter Studio, should have a newly generated token mint. By using the mint, you can get the config key and pool addresses associated to it: Dynamic Bonding Curve pool and Meteora DAMM V2 pool.

```js  theme={null}
const poolAddressResponse = await (
    await fetch(
      `https://lite-api.jup.ag/studio/v1/dbc-pool/addresses/${mint}`,
    )
).json();
```

## Fee

Using the Pool Address, you will be able to get the total and current unclaimed fees in the Dynamic Bonding Curve pool.

```js  theme={null}
const feeResponse = await (
    await fetch (
      'https://lite-api.jup.ag/studio/v1/dbc/fee',
      {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',

        body: JSON.stringify({
            poolAddress: poolAddressResponse.data.dbcPoolAddress,
        }, null, 2)
    })
).json();
```

## Claim Fee

In order to claim fees from a Dynamic Bonding Curve pool, you will need to pass in the pool address into this endpoint and we will create the Claim Fee transaction for you. After receiving the transaction, you will need to sign and submit the transaction to the network on your own ([refer to Transaction Sending Example above](#prerequisite)).

```js  theme={null}
const claimTransaction = await (
    await fetch (
      'https://lite-api.jup.ag/studio/v1/dbc/fee/create-tx',

1. `transaction`: A base64-encoded unsigned transaction.
2. `mint`: The mint of the token that is being created.
3. `imagePresignedUrl`: A `PUT` request endpoint to upload your token image.
4. `metadataPresignedUrl`: A `PUT` request endpoint to upload your token metadata.
5. `imageUrl`: The token's static image url to be used in the metadata.

).json();
```

## Token Metadata

The following 2 steps, are to upload your token image and metadata to the **static URL**, which will be the URI in the onchain metadata of your token.

Example

* URI/ Off-chain Metadata: `https://static-create.jup.ag/metadata/{mint}.json`
* Image: `https://static-create.jup.ag/images/{mint}`

You can refer to this to understand Token Metadata on Solana: [https://developers.metaplex.com/token-metadata](https://developers.metaplex.com/token-metadata)

### Upload Image

From the response of the `create-tx` endpoint, we will need the `imagePresignedUrl` to make a **`PUT` request** to the url provided, in order to upload the token image.

```js  theme={null}
const imageResponse = await fetch(createTransaction.imagePresignedUrl, {
    method: 'PUT',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'image/jpeg', // Adjust based on the image type passed in previously
    },
    body: fs.readFileSync('./token.jpeg'), // Assuming the image file is located in the same folder
});
```

### Upload Metadata

From the response of the `create-tx` endpoint, we will need the `metadataPresignedUrl` to make a **`PUT` request** to the url provided, in order to upload the token metadata.

```js  theme={null}
const metadataResponse = await fetch(createTransaction.metadataPresignedUrl, {
    method: 'PUT',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        name: '',
        symbol: '',
        description: '',
        image: createTransaction.imageUrl,
        website: '',
        twitter: '',
        telegram: '',
    }, null, 2),
});
```

## Submit Transaction

After you have uploaded your token image and token metadata, you can proceed to signing and making a post request to the `submit` endpoint - this will allow Jupiter Studio to complete the transaction and submit it to the network on your behalf.

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  * Do note that the endpoint expects the `requestBody`'s `content` to be in [`multipart/form-data` format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest_API/Using_FormData_Objects).
  * Ensure the file types and size of the image file is manageable.
</Info>

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  The `content` and `headerImage` refers to the Studio dedicated page's token description and header image of the page, they are not on-chain metadata. This is meant for you to customize the Studio dedicated page as you wish - to include lore, story or just a nice looking banner!

  The `content` and `headerImage` are stored off-chain for our frontend to ingest and display.

  [Do not confuse this with the uploading of token metadata, they are done separately.](#token-metadata)
</Info>

```js  theme={null}
import { VersionedTransaction } from '@solana/web3.js';
import fs from 'fs';

const transaction = VersionedTransaction.deserialize(Buffer.from(createTransaction.transaction, 'base64'));
transaction.sign([wallet]);
const signedTransaction = Buffer.from(transaction.serialize()).toString('base64');

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('transaction', signedTransaction);
formData.append('owner', wallet.publicKey.toBase58());
formData.append('content', '');
formData.append(
    'headerImage',
    new File(
        [fs.readFileSync('/Path/to/header.jpeg')],
        'header.jpeg',
        { type: 'image/jpeg' },
    )
);

const result = await (
    await fetch (
      'https://lite-api.jup.ag/studio/v1/dbc-pool/submit',
      {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData,
    })
).json();
```


# Studio API
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/studio/index



Studio is built for culture architects who want:

* Aggressive experimentation.
* Tools for growth and alignment.
* Collaborative and supportive vibe culture between Studio projects.

## About

Studio is a powerful playground equipped with a suite of tools for creators. Each feature is strategic towards how creators might want to customize to fit their needs - like flexible bonding curves, custom vesting schedules, and selectable quote mints to encode your vision.

**Features**

* LP Fees: 50% before AND after graduation.
* LP Locking: Optional 50% of the graduated LP unlocks after 1 year.
* Vested Tokens: 0 - 80% of token supply, with optional vesting schedule and cliff.
* Flexible parameters: Quote mint, Market cap bonding, etc.
* Other helpful tools: Anti-sniper suite, Lp Locking.

**Dedicated Studio Token Page**

Apart from the strategic levers, start rallying your community with the dedicated Studio page with seamless content integration with jup.ag's token page.

* Dedicated Studio page for each token.
* Content from Studio shows up in jup.ag's token page.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is my Studio token page showing 'Token not found'?">
    * In order for us to track and store your token information, header image or token description, you **must** send your signed transaction from the `create_tx` endpoint to the `submit` endpoint.
    * This will allow us to store your token into our database and reflect it as a Studio token on our frontend.
    * If you submit the transaction on your own or some other way, the token will not have a dedicated Studio page.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What do I do with the presigned URLs?">
    * Those URLs are for you to upload your token's metadata and image to a static endpoint, which will be in the token's URI metadata onchain.
    * You are required to make a PUT request to those endpoints, [you can refer to this section on the usage](/docs/studio/create-token#token-metadata).
    * If you do not upload your token image and metadata to this endpoint, your token will not have any image/metadata reflected onchain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the rate limit of Studio API?">
    * Lite URL: `https://lite-api.jup.ag/studio/v1`: 100 requests per 5 minutes
    * Pro URL: `https://api.jup.ag/studio/v1`: 10 requests per 10 seconds (for all Tiers)

# Add Fees To Swap
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/swap/add-fees-to-swap

Walkthrough on how to add fees to the Legacy Swap API.

<Note>
  **INFO**

  As of January 2025, when integrating the Legacy Swap API, you no longer need to use the Referral Program to set up a `referralAccount` and `referralTokenAccount` to collect fees from the swaps you provide to the end users.

  Simply, just pass in any valid token account as the `feeAccount` parameter in the Legacy Swap API.

  However, do note that **it is still applicable to the Trigger API**.

  **NOTE**

  You can still find information about the Referral Program.

  The Referral Program is an open source program by Jupiter to provide referral fees for integrators who are integrating Jupiter Swap and Jupiter Limit Order. You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/TeamRaccoons/referral) to gain a better understanding of how it works.
</Info>

## Overview

By default, there are **zero** protocol fees on Jupiter Swap. Integrators have the option to introduce a platform fee denoted in basis points, e.g. **20 bps** for **0.2%** of the token input or output.

### Important Notes

* For ExactIn swaps, the `feeAccount`'s mint can be either the **input mint or output mint** of the swap pair, and not any other mints.
* For ExactOut swaps, the `feeAccount`'s mint can only be the **input mint** of the swap pair.
* Example, if you swap JUP to USDC, you cannot take fees in SOL, it has to be part of the swap pair.
* It supports SPL and Token2022 tokens.
  * [Refer to this update for support of Token2022 tokens](/updates#jupiter-aggregator-v6-program-update).
* Referral Program is no longer required for Legacy Swap API.

### 1. Set up

You will need to complete the prerequisites and understanding of [Environment Setup](/get-started/environment-setup) and [Get Quote and Swap](/docs/swap/get-quote) guide as this is reliant on the Legacy Swap API.

### 2. Set your fee in Quote

Setting your fee is simple, just add `platformFeeBps` parameter to the `/quote` endpoint.

In this example, we set `platformFeeBps` to `20` which equates to 0.2%.

```js  theme={null}
const quoteResponse = await (
    await fetch(
        'https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/quote? +
        'inputMint=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112&' +
        'outputMint=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v&' +
        'amount=100000&' +
        'slippageBps=50&' +
        'restrictIntermediateTokens=true&' +
        'platformFeeBps=20&' +
        'instructionVersion=V2' // required if you want to collect fees in Token2022 tokens
    )
  ).json();
```

### 3. Set your feeAccount in Swap

In the `/swap` endpoint, you will need to pass in the `feeAccount` parameter.

* The `feeAccount` is a token account that will receive the fees from the swap - the mint of the token account has to be part of the swap pair.
* Do ensure that the token account needs to be initialized beforehand and is the correct mint to receive the fees in.
* For ExactIn swaps, the `feeAccount`'s mint can be either the **input mint or output mint** of the swap pair, and not any other mints.
* For ExactOut swaps, the `feeAccount`'s mint can only be the **input mint** of the swap pair.
* Example, if you swap JUP to USDC, you cannot take fees in SOL, it has to be part of the swap pair.
* Refer to the [Create Token Account](#create-token-account) section to create a token account.

```js  theme={null}
const swapResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://api.jup.ag/swap/v1/swap', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            quoteResponse,
            userPublicKey: wallet.publicKey, // Pass in actual referred user in production
            feeAccount: feeAccount, // feeAccount is the token account that will receive the fees
        })
    })
).json();
```

### 4. Sign and send transaction

Finally, the user can sign the transaction and it can be submitted to the network to be executed. You can refer to the [Send Swap Transaction](/docs/swap/send-swap-transaction) guide to complete this step.

### Create Token Account

To create a token account, you can use the following code or refer to [Solana Cookbook](https://solana.com/developers/cookbook/tokens/create-token-account).

* The code creates the transaction to create the token account and handles the transaction siging and sending.
* If the token account already exists, it will not create and might throw an error such as `Provided owner is not allowed`.

```js  theme={null}
import { createAssociatedTokenAccount } from "@solana/spl-token";

const mintPubkey = new PublicKey(
    "JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN",
);

let ata = await createAssociatedTokenAccount(
    connection, // connection
    wallet, // fee payer
    mintPubkey, // mint
    wallet.publicKey, // owner of the token account
    // confirmOptions, // if you need to skip simulation and send the transaction immediately
    // programId, // if you need to use a different token program id such as token-2022
    // associatedTokenProgramId,
    // allowOwnerOffCurve, // if you need to allow the owner to be off curve
);
console.log(`ATA: ${ata.toBase58()}`);
```

## For Trigger API Integrator Fee

**Important Notes**

* The Jupiter Swap project account for the Referral Program is `45ruCyfdRkWpRNGEqWzjCiXRHkZs8WXCLQ67Pnpye7Hp`.

* The `referralTokenAccount` can either be:

  * **Input mint or the output mint** on the swap for ExactIn.
  * **Input mint ONLY** on the swap for ExactOut.

* You can use the [Dashboard](https://referral.jup.ag/dashboard), [SDK](https://github.com/TeamRaccoons/referral/blob/main/example/src/createReferralAccount.ts) or [API](https://referral.jup.ag/api) to set up the `referralAccount` and `referralTokenAccount` in this guide.

**1. Set up**

**Obtain `referralAccount` and `referralTokenAccount`**

There are 2 ways you can set up a referral account.

1. Use our [referral dashboard](https://referral.jup.ag/dashboard) to create them. After creating, remember to find your `Referral Key` on the page and the associated token accounts.
2. Use our SDK to create them. You can use the [example scripts](https://github.com/TeamRaccoons/referral/tree/main/example/src) to create.

**Obtain `mintAccount`**

As for the mint account, assuming you have an interface where a user swaps, you will know up front what are the input or output mints. For the sake of example, we will use a hardcoded mint public key.

```js  theme={null}
const referralAccount = new Publickey('ReplaceWithPubkey');
const mintAccount = new Publickey('So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112');
```

**2. Get your referral token account for `feeAccount`**

In order to refer and receive fees from all types of tokens, you will need to have already initialize `referralTokenAccount`s (owned by your `referralAccount`) for the mint in the order.

In this code block, we will be using the SDK to try to find the `referralTokenAccount` based on our previously defined `referralAccount` and `mintAccount`. If the token account is not found, it will send a transaction to the network to attempt to initialize one for the mint.

```js  theme={null}
import { ReferralProvider } from "@jup-ag/referral-sdk";

const { tx, referralTokenAccountPubKey } = await provider.initializeReferralTokenAccount({
    payerPubKey: wallet.publicKey,
    referralAccountPubKey: referralAccount,
    mint: mintAccount,
});

const referralTokenAccount = await connection.getAccountInfo(referralTokenAccountPubKey);

// Attempt to initialize a token account
if (!referralTokenAccount) {
    const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, tx, [wallet]);
    console.log({ signature, referralTokenAccountPubKey: referralTokenAccountPubKey.toBase58() });

// Since initialized, it will carry on
} else {
    console.log(`referralTokenAccount ${referralTokenAccountPubKey.toBase58()} for mint ${mintAccount.toBase58()} already exists`);
};

const feeAccount = referralTokenAccountPubKey;
console.log(feeAccount);
```

If you are confident that the `referralTokenAccount` for specific mints have been created, you can use this method to get it. **Do note that, even if the token account is not intialized, it will still return a pubkey as it is a Program Derived Address and is deterministic. [Read more here.](https://solana.com/docs/core/pda#findprogramaddress)**

```js  theme={null}
const [feeAccount] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
    [
        Buffer.from("referral_ata"), // A string that signifies the account type, here "referral_ata."
        referralAccount.toBuffer(), //  The public key of the referral account converted into a buffer.
        mintAccount.toBuffer(), // The mint public key, converted into a buffer.
    ],
    new PublicKey("REFER4ZgmyYx9c6He5XfaTMiGfdLwRnkV4RPp9t9iF3") // The public key of the Referral Program
);
```

**3. Set your `feeAccount` and `params.feeBps`**

Setting your referral fee is simple, just add `feeAccount` and `params.feeBps` parameters to the `/createOrder` endpoint.

In this example, we set `params.feeBps` to `20` which equates to 0.2%.

```js  theme={null}
const createOrderResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/createOrder', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            inputMint: inputMint.toString(),
            outputMint: outputMint.toString(),
            maker: "jdocuPgEAjMfihABsPgKEvYtsmMzjUHeq9LX4Hvs7f3",
            payer: "jdocuPgEAjMfihABsPgKEvYtsmMzjUHeq9LX4Hvs7f3",
            params: {
                makingAmount: "1000000",
                takingAmount: "300000",
                // slippageBps: "", // Optional, by nature, trigger orders execute with 0 slippage
                // expiredAt: "", // In unix seconds (e.g. Date.now()/1_000) or optional
                feeBps: "20", // feeBps is the amount of fees in bps that will be sent to the fee account
            },
            computeUnitPrice: "auto",
            feeAccount, // feeAccount is the token account that will receive the fees
            // wrapAndUnwrapSol: true, // Default true or optional
        })
    })
).json();
```


# Build Swap Transaction

  </CardGroup>
</Info>

The Legacy Swap API is one of the ways for you to interact with the Jupiter Swap Aggregator program. Before you send a transaction to the network, you will need to build the transaction that defines the instructions to execute and accounts to read/write to.

It can be complex to handle this yourself, but good news! Most of our APIs and SDKs just handles it for you, so you get a response with the transaction to be prepared and sent to the network.

<Tip>
  **USE LEGACY SWAP API TO HANDLE IT FOR YOU OR...**

  If you are looking to interact with the Jupiter Swap Aggregator program in a different way, check out the other guides:

  **Swap Instructions**

  To compose with instructions and build your own transaction, [read how to use the `/swap-instructions` in this section](#build-your-own-transaction-with-instructions).

  **Flash Fill or Cross Program Invocation (CPI)**

  To interact with your own Solana program, [read how to use the **Flash Fill method** or **CPI** in this section](#build-your-own-transaction-with-flash-fill-or-cpi).
</Tip>

## Let’s Get Started

In this guide, we will pick up from where [**Get Quote**](/docs/swap/get-quote) guide has left off.

If you have not set up your environment to use the necessary libraries, the RPC connection to the network and successfully get a quote from the Quote API, please start at [Environment Setup](/get-started/environment-setup) or [get quote](/docs/swap/get-quote).

<Tip>
  **API REFERENCE**

  To fully utilize the Legacy Swap API, check out the [Legacy Swap API or Swap Instructions Reference](/api-reference/swap/swap).
</Tip>

## Legacy Swap API

From the previous guide on getting a quote, now using the quote response and your wallet, you can receive a **serialized swap transaction** that needs to be prepared and signed before sending to the network.

## Get Serialized Transaction

Using the root URL and parameters to pass in, it is as simple as the example code below!

<Tip>
  **OPTIMIZING FOR TRANSACTION LANDING IS SUPER SUPER IMPORTANT!**

  This code block includes additional parameters that our Legacy Swap API supports, such as estimating compute units, priority fees and slippage, to optimize for transaction landing.

  To understand how these parameters help, the next step, [Send Swap Transaction guide](/docs/swap/send-swap-transaction) will discuss them.
</Tip>

```js  theme={null}
const swapResponse = await (
await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/swap', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
    quoteResponse,
    userPublicKey: wallet.publicKey,

    // ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS TO OPTIMIZE FOR TRANSACTION LANDING
    // See next guide to optimize for transaction landing
    dynamicComputeUnitLimit: true,
    dynamicSlippage: true,
    prioritizationFeeLamports: {
          priorityLevelWithMaxLamports: {
            maxLamports: 1000000,
            priorityLevel: "veryHigh"
          }
        }
    })
})
).json();

console.log(swapResponse);
```

From the above example, you should see this response.

```js  theme={null}
{
    swapTransaction: 'AQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAQAGDkS+3LuGTbs......+/oD9qb31dH6i0QZ2IHELXUX3Y1YeW79p9Stkqk12z4yvZFJiQ4GCQwLBwYQBgUEDggNTQ==',
    lastValidBlockHeight: 279632475,
    prioritizationFeeLamports: 9999,
    computeUnitLimit: 388876,
    prioritizationType: {
        computeBudget: {
            microLamports: 25715,
            estimatedMicroLamports: 785154
        }
    },
    dynamicSlippageReport: {
        slippageBps: 50,
        otherAmount: 20612318,
        simulatedIncurredSlippageBps: -18,
        amplificationRatio: '1.5',
        categoryName: 'lst',
        heuristicMaxSlippageBps: 100
    },
    simulationError: null
}
```

## What’s Next

Now, you are able to get a quote and use our Legacy Swap API to build the swap transaction for you. Next steps is to proceed to prepare and sign the transaction and send the signed transaction to the network.

### Build Your Own Transaction With Instructions

If you prefer to compose with instructions instead of the provided transaction that is returned from the `/swap` endpoint (like the above example). You can post to `/swap-instructions` instead, it takes the same parameters as the `/swap` endpoint but returns you the instructions rather than the serialized transaction.

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  In some cases, you may add more accounts to the transaction, which may exceed the transaction size limits. To work around this, you can use the `maxAccounts` parameter in `/quote` endpoint to limit the number of accounts in the transaction.

  [Refer to the GET /quote's `maxAccounts` guide for more details.](/docs/swap/get-quote#max-accounts)
</Info>

<Accordion title="/swap-instructions code snippet">

      computeBudgetInstructions, // The necessary instructions to setup the compute budget.

### Build Your Own Transaction With Flash Fill Or CPI

If you prefer to interact with the Jupiter Swap Aggregator program with your own on-chain program. There are 2 ways to do it, typically on-chain program call **Cross Program Invocation (CPI)** to interact with each other, we also have another method called **Flash Fill** built by Jupiter (due to limitations of CPI in the past).

<Note>
  **CPI IS NOW RECOMMENDED!**

  As of January 2025, Jupiter Swap via CPI is recommended for most users.

  [The `Loosen CPI restriction` feature has been deployed on Solana, you can read more here](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/26641).
</Note>

<Tip>
  **WHY FLASH FILL?**

  With Jupiter's complex routing, best prices comes at a cost. It often means more compute resources and accounts are required as it would route across multiple DEXes in one transaction.

  Solana transactions are limited to 1232 bytes, Jupiter is using [Address Lookup Tables (ALTs)](https://docs.solana.com/developing/lookup-tables) to include more accounts in one transaction. However, the CPI method cannot use ALTs, which means when you add more accounts to a Jupiter Swap transaction, it will likely fail if it exceeds the transaction size limits.

  **Flash Fill allows the use of Versioned Transaction and ALTs**, hence, reducing the total accounts used for a Jupiter Swap transaction.
</Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="CPI References">
    **A CPI transaction will be composed of these instructions:**

    1. Borrow enough SOL from the program to open a wSOL account that the program owns.
    2. Swap X token from the user to wSOL on Jupiter via CPI.
    3. Close the wSOL account and send it to the program.
    4. The program then transfers the SOL back to the user.

### DEX Program Errors

In the swap transaction, the DEX in routing may return errors. You can find some of their IDLs and/or error codes in an explorer. If they do not support public IDLs or open source code, you can reference the common errors below or if you need additional help, please reach out to [Jupiter Discord](https://discord.gg/jup).

| Error                                                   | Description                                                                                           |
| :------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Error related to tick array or bitmap extension account | Similar to slippage, the price or market has "moved out of range", hence the swap transaction failed. |

## Routing Errors

The common routing errors you may encounter are usually related to attempting to swap a token that is not tradable on Jupiter, for reasons such as lack of liquidity or the token is not supported.

| Error                                                | Description                                                                                                               | Debug                                                                                                                                                                                      |

# Get Quote
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/swap/get-quote

Swap via Metis by getting a quote from the Legacy Swap API.

The Quote API enables you to tap into the Jupiter Metis v1 Routing Engine, which accesses the deep liquidity available within the DEXes of Solana's DeFi ecosystem. In this guide, we will walkthrough how you can get a quote for a specific token pair and other related parameters.

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  * Lite URL: `https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/quote`
  * Pro URL: `https://api.jup.ag/swap/v1/quote`

<Warning>
  **ROUTING ENGINE**

  The quotes from Legacy Swap API are from the Jupiter Metis v1 Routing Engine.
</Warning>

## Let’s Get Started

In this guide, we will be using the Solana web3.js package.

If you have not set up your environment to use the necessary libraries and the connection to the Solana network, please head over to [Environment Setup](/get-started/environment-setup).

<Tip>
  **API REFERENCE**

  To fully utilize the Legacy Quote API, check out the [Legacy Quote API Reference](/api-reference/swap/quote).
</Tip>

## Legacy Quote API

The most common trading pair on Solana is SOL and USDC, to get a quote for this specific token pair, you need to pass in the required parameters such as:

| Parameters  | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| inputMint   | The pubkey or token mint address e.g. So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112                                                                                          |
| outputMint  | The pubkey or token mint address e.g. EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v                                                                                         |
| amount      | The number of **input** tokens before the decimal is applied, also known as the “raw amount” or “integer amount” in lamports for SOL or atomic units for all other tokens. |
| slippageBps | The number of basis points you can tolerate to lose during time of execution. e.g. 1% = 100bps                                                                             |

## Get Quote

Using the root URL and parameters to pass in, it is as simple as the example code below!

```js  theme={null}
const quoteResponse = await (
    await fetch(
        'https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/quote?inputMint=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112&outputMint=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v&amount=100000000&slippageBps=50&restrictIntermediateTokens=true'
    )
  ).json();

console.log(JSON.stringify(quoteResponse, null, 2));
```

Example response:

```json expandable theme={null}
{
  "inputMint": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
  "inAmount": "100000000",
  "outputMint": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
  "outAmount": "16198753",
  "otherAmountThreshold": "16117760",
  "swapMode": "ExactIn",
  "slippageBps": 50,
  "platformFee": null,
  "priceImpactPct": "0",
  "routePlan": [
    {
      "swapInfo": {
        "ammKey": "5BKxfWMbmYBAEWvyPZS9esPducUba9GqyMjtLCfbaqyF",
        "label": "Meteora DLMM",
        "inputMint": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
        "outputMint": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
        "inAmount": "100000000",
        "outAmount": "16198753",
        "feeAmount": "24825",
        "feeMint": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112"
      },
      "percent": 100
    }
  ],
  "contextSlot": 299283763,
  "timeTaken": 0.015257836
}
```

<Tip>
  **TIP**

  `outAmount` refers to the best possible output amount based on the route at time of quote, this means that `slippageBps` does not affect.
</Tip>

## What’s Next

Now, you are able to get a quote, next steps is to submit a transaction to execute the swap based on the quote given. Let’s go!

## Additional Resources

### Restrict Intermediate Tokens

`restrictIntermediateTokens` can be set to `true` . If your route is routed through random intermediate tokens, it will fail more frequently. With this, we make sure that your route is only routed through highly liquid intermediate tokens to give you the best price and more stable route.

### Legacy Transactions

All Jupiter swaps are using Versioned Transactions and [Address Lookup Tables](https://docs.solana.com/developing/lookup-tables). However, not all wallets support Versioned Transactions yet, so if you detect a wallet that does not support versioned transactions, you will need to set the `asLegacyTransaction` parameter to `true`.

### Adding Fees

By using the Quote API in your app, you can add a fee to charge your users. You can refer to the `platformFeeBps` parameter and to add it to your quote and in conjuction, add `feeAccount` (it can be any valid token account) to your swap request.

### Direct Routes

In some cases, you may want to restrict the routing to only go through 1 market. You can use the `onlyDirectRoutes` parameter to achieve this. This will ensure routing will only go through 1 market.

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  * If there are no direct routes, there will be no quote.
  * If there is only 1 market but it is illiquid, it will still return the route with the illiquid market.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **UNFAVORABLE TRADES**

  Please be aware that using `onlyDirectRoutes` can often yield unfavorable trades or outcomes.
</Warning>

### Max Accounts

In some cases, you may want to add more accounts to the transaction for specific use cases, but it might exceed the transaction size limit. You can use the `maxAccounts` parameter to limit the number of accounts in the transaction.

<Warning>
  **UNFAVORABLE TRADES**

  Please be aware that the misuse of `maxAccounts` can yield unfavorable trades or outcomes.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **TIP**

  Refer to the [Requote with Lower Max Accounts](/docs/swap/requote-with-lower-max-accounts) guide for more information on how to requote and adjust the swap when using `maxAccounts`.
</Tip>

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  * `maxAccounts` is an estimation and the actual number of accounts may vary.
  * `maxAccounts` only applies to the total number of accounts of the inner swaps in the swap instruction and not any of the setup, cleanup or other instructions (see the example below).
  * We recommend setting `maxAccounts` to 64
  * Keep `maxAccounts` as large as possible, only reduce `maxAccounts` if you exceed the transaction size limit.
  * If `maxAccounts` is set too low, example to 30, the computed route may drop DEXes/AMMs like Meteora DLMM that require more than 30 accounts.

  **Jupiter has 2 types of routing instructions**, if you plan to limit `maxAccounts`, you will need to account for if the market is routable with [ALTs](https://docs.solana.com/developing/lookup-tables) or not:

  * **`Routing Instruction`** (Simple Routing): The market is still new, and we do not have ALTs set up for the market, hence the number of accounts required is higher as there are more accounts required.
  * **`Shared Accounts Routing Instruction`**: The market has sufficient liquidity (and has been live for a while), and we have [ALTs](https://docs.solana.com/developing/lookup-tables) set up for the market to be used in the routing instruction, hence the number of accounts required is lower as there are less accounts required.

    * You can see that there are a total of 2 inner swaps where the number of accounts respectively are

      * Stabble Stable Swap: 12
      * Lifinity Swap V2: 13
      * Total: 25

    * The `maxAccounts` parameter is to control this value - to limit the total number of accounts in the inner swaps.

    * It doesn’t take into the consideration of a few things:

      * Each of the inner swap's program address, so 2 in this case.
      * Top level routing instruction accounts where in this case Shared Accounts Route is 13 and Route is 9.
      * There are also other accounts that are required to set up, clean up, etc which are not counted in the `maxAccounts` parameter

# About Legacy Swap API
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/swap/index



The Jupiter Legacy Swap API enables you to tap into the Jupiter Metis v1 Routing Engine, which aggregates across all liquidity available within the DEXes of Solana's DeFi ecosystem, allowing you to swap seamlessly from any token to any token.

## We recommend using Ultra Swap API

Ultra Swap API is the spiritual successor to Swap API, and is much simpler to use than Swap API. If you are first starting out on your Solana development journey, using Ultra Swap API is highly recommended over Swap API.

<Tip>
  For more information about Ultra Swap API, please refer to the [Ultra Swap API](/docs/ultra) documentation.
</Tip>

<Info>
  **Using Legacy Swap API**

  Requires your own maintenance, optimizations and dependencies.

  * **Upkeep of RPCs**: To retrieve wallet balances, broadcast and retrieve transactions, etc.
  * **Deciding transaction fee**: Including, but not limited to, priority fee, Jito fee, etc.
  * **Deciding slippage**: The optimal slippage to use to balance between trade success and price protection, do note that [RTSE is only available via Ultra Swap API](/docs/ultra#real-time-slippage-estimator).
  * **Broadcasting the transaction**: Ultra uses a proprietary transaction sending engine which dramatically improves landing rate and speed.
  * **Parsing the swap results**: Polling and parsing the resulting transaction from the RPC, including handling for success and error cases.

  Though comes with other ways to use Jupiter.

  * Add custom instructions.
  * Use via Cross Program Invocation (CPI) calls.
  * Choose your own transactionbroadcasting method (like Typical RPCs, Jito, etc).
  * Modify the number of accounts to use in a transaction.
</Info>

## Getting Started with Legacy Swap API

1. [**Get Quote**](/docs/swap/get-quote): Request for a quote which consists of the route plan, and other params such as integrator fee, slippage, etc.

2. [**Build Swap Transaction**](/docs/swap/build-swap-transaction): Post the quote to build a swap transaction.

   * You can utilize other methods to return swap instructions or use CPI rather than the default swap transaction.
   * You can utilize other parameters such as priority fee, dynamic slippage, etc to customize the transaction.

3. [**Send Swap Transaction**](/docs/swap/send-swap-transaction): Sign and send the swap transaction to the network via your preferred RPC or other methods.

**Other Guides**

* [**Adding Fees to Legacy Swap API**](/docs/swap/add-fees-to-swap): Add custom integrator fees to the swap transaction.
* [**Using Legacy Swap API as a payment method**](/docs/swap/payments-through-swap): Use Legacy Swap API as a payment method for your users.


# Payments Through Swap
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/swap/payments-through-swap

Walkthrough on how to use the Legacy Swap API as a form of payment method.

The Jupiter Legacy Swap API can be utilized such that you, a merchant can allow your customer to pay in any tokens while you still receive in your preferred token payment at the end of the transaction.

## Use Case

Let’s set the stage. You are selling a **jupcake!!!** to your customer and merchant might only accept in 1 USDC, but your customer only has 1 SOL. Well, you’re at the right place! By using the Legacy Swap API, merchant can let customer pay in SOL while merchant still receive USDC in order to complete the payment for a jupcake.

* Customer has 1,000,000 SOL.
* Merchant sells 1 jupcake for 1 USDC.
* Use the Legacy Swap API to swap exactly 1 USDC output from Customer's SOL.
* Merchant receives the 1 USDC, as planned!

## Let’s Get Started

### 1. Setup

You will need slightly different imports and also remember to set up connection to an RPC. If you have not set up the other typical libraries or are familiar with the Legacy Swap API, please follow this [Environment Setup](/get-started/environment-setup) and [Get Quote and Swap](/docs/swap/get-quote) guide.

```bash  theme={null}
npm i @solana/spl-token
```

```js  theme={null}
import { PublicKey, Connection, Keypair, VersionedTransaction } from '@solana/web3.js';
import { getAssociatedTokenAddress, TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID } from '@solana/spl-token';
```

Before we start getting a quote and swap transaction, for example sake, we will need to prepare both merchant and customer accounts. In production scenario, you will need to dynamically pass this in and allow users to sign in their device interfaces.

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  Do note that you will need to have already set up:

  * **A wallet in your machine to simulate yourself as the customer as the customer is the signer of the transaction** (similar to how we set up in [Environment Setup](/get-started/environment-setup)).
  * `trackingAccount` is an additional Solana Account you can pass in to track only Jupiter transactions easily.
</Info>

#### Set Up Accounts

```js  theme={null}
const privateKeyArray = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/Path/to/.config/solana/id.json', 'utf8').trim());
const customerWallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(privateKeyArray));

const USDC_MINT = new PublicKey('EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v'); // Your preferred token payment
const customerAccount = customerWallet.publicKey;
const merchantAccount = new PublicKey('ReplaceWithMerchantPubkey');
// const trackingAccount = new PublicKey('ReplaceWithPubkey'); // If required

console.log("USDC_MINT:", USDC_MINT.publicKey);
console.log("merchantAccount:", merchantAccount.publicKey);
// console.log("trackingAccount:", trackingAccount.publicKey);
```

#### Set Up `destinationTokenAccount`

One more thing you will need to set up! Later on, you will need to pass in `destinationTokenAccount` which will be your token account for your preferred token payment mint. **Do note that it is the merchant's token account and it needs to be initialized.**

```js  theme={null}
// Get the associated token account for the merchant wallet
const merchantUSDCTokenAccount = await getAssociatedTokenAddress(
	  USDC_MINT,
	  merchantAccount,
	  true,
	  TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
	  ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
);

console.log("merchantUSDCTokenAccount:", merchantUSDCTokenAccount.publicKey);
```

### 2. Set `swapMode` to `ExactOut` in Quote

Next, the merchant have to [Get Quote](/docs/swap/get-quote) for the customer. We are using the `ExactOut` mode because we know exactly how much output amount (1 USDC) the merchant want to receive but not sure how much input amount the customer should pay with.

By getting a quote first, the customer can know upfront the specific amount of input token before they approve and sign the transaction.

<Warning>
  **LIMITATIONS OF `ExactOut`**

  Currently, there are some limitations as `ExactOut` is not widely supported across all DEXes.

  * Supported DEXes are only Orca Whirlpool, Raydium CLMM, and Raydium CPMM.
  * NOT ALL token pairs may be available.
</Warning>

```js  theme={null}
const quoteResponse = await (
    await fetch(
        'https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/quote?inputMint=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112&outputMint=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v&amount=100000&slippageBps=50&restrictIntermediateTokens=true&swapMode=ExactOut'
    )
  ).json();

console.log(JSON.stringify(quoteResponse, null, 2));
```

From the this quote, you should get part of the response like this, where `amount` specified in the query parameter represents the `outAmount` in the response and of course, `swapMode: ExactOut`.

```js  theme={null}
{
    "inputMint": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
    "inAmount": "4434914",
    "outputMint": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
    "outAmount": "1000000",
    "otherAmountThreshold": "4434914",
    "swapMode": "ExactOut",
    ...
}
```

### 3. Set `destinationTokenAccount` in Swap

The merchant then retrieves the serialized swap transaction, but the merchant need to specify the `destinationTokenAccount` in the parameters — this will build the swap transaction to swap but send to the [merchant's specified token account which we defined earlier](#set-up-destinationtokenaccount).

The `destinationTokenAccount` should be the merchant’s token account to receive the payment in. Also do note that `customerAccount` should be accounted for. **You can refer to the [Build Swap Transaction](/docs/swap/build-swap-transaction) guide for other parameters to be passed in.**

```js  theme={null}
const swapResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/swap', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            quoteResponse,
            userPublicKey: customerAccount.publicKey,
            destinationTokenAccount: merchantUSDCTokenAccount.publicKey,
            // trackingAccount: trackingAccount.publicKey,
        })
    })
).json();
```

### 4. Prepare Transaction

We have walked through the steps here and explained some of the code, you can refer to [Send Swap Transaction - Prepare Transaction](/docs/swap/send-swap-transaction#prepare-transaction). The main difference for payments is to ensure that the customer is the fee payer (the merchant can be generous and be the fee payer too!) and the signer.

```js  theme={null}
const transactionBase64 = swapResponse.swapTransaction
const transaction = VersionedTransaction.deserialize(Buffer.from(transactionBase64, 'base64'));
transaction.feePayer = customerAccount.publicKey;
transaction.sign([customerWallet]);
const transactionBinary = transaction.serialize();
```

### 5. Send Transaction

We have walked through the steps here and explained some of the code, you can refer to [Send Swap Transaction - Send Transaction](/docs/swap/send-swap-transaction#send-transaction). The main difference for payments is, you might want to try adjusting `maxRetries` to a higher count as it is not time sensitive and ideally this is used with tighter slippage and ensuring the `inputMint` is not too unstable.

Do note that more retries will cause the user to wait slightly longer, so find the balance between the two. Read more here: [https://solana.com/docs/advanced/retry](https://solana.com/docs/advanced/retry).

```js  theme={null}
const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(transactionBinary, {
    maxRetries: 10,
});

const confirmation = await connection.confirmTransaction({ signature }, "finalized");

if (confirmation.value.err) {
    throw new Error(`Transaction failed: ${JSON.stringify(confirmation.value.err)}\nhttps://solscan.io/${signature}/`);
} else console.log(`Transaction successful: https://solscan.io/tx/${signature}/`);
```

The succeeded Swap Transaction should show:

* Token A swaps from the customer's token account
* Token A swap to Token B
* Token B sends to the merchant's token account

# Requote with Lower Max Accounts
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/swap/requote-with-lower-max-accounts

Walkthrough on how to requote with lower max accounts via the Legacy Swap API.

In some cases where you might be limited or require strict control by adding your own instructions to the swap transaction, you might face issues with exceeding transaction size limit. In this section, we will provide some helping code to help you requote when the transaction size is too large.

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  We provide a `maxAccounts` param in the `/quote` endpoint to allow you to reduce the total number of accounts used for a swap - this will allow you to add your own instructions.

  <CardGroup>
    <Card title="Refer to this section for more information and do note its limitations and important notes before using" href="/docs/swap-api/get-quote#max-accounts" icon="book-open" horizontal />
  </CardGroup>
</Info>

## Example Code

1. Request for quote and the swap transaction as per normal.

2. Serialize the transaction.

3. Use the conditions to check if the transaction is too large.

   1. If too large, requote again with lower max accounts - do note that the route will change.
   2. If not, sign and send to the network.

<Tip>
  **TIP**

  We recommend `maxAccounts` 64 and start as high as you can, then incrementally reduce when requoting.

  Do note that with lower max accounts, it will might yield bad routes or no route at all.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **TIP**

  When you serialize the transaction, you can log the number of raw bytes being used in the transaction.

  You can either add your custom instructions before or after serializing the transaction.

# Send Swap Transaction
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/swap/send-swap-transaction

Swap via Metis by sending a swap transaction to the network.

Transaction sending can be very simple but optimizing for transaction landing can be challenging. This is critical in periods of network congestion when many users and especially bots are competing for block space to have their transactions processed.

<Tip>
  **IMPROVE TRANSACTION LANDING TIP**

  By using Jupiter Legacy Swap API, you can enable Dynamic Slippage, Priority Fee estimation and Compute Unit estimation, all supported on our backend and served directly to you through our API.
</Tip>

## Let’s Get Started

In this guide, we will pick up from where [**Get Quote**](/docs/swap/get-quote) and [**Build Swap Transaction**](/docs/swap/build-swap-transaction) guide has left off.

If you have not set up your environment to use the necessary libraries, the RPC connection to the network and successfully get a quote from the Quote API, please start at [Environment Setup](/get-started/environment-setup) or [get quote](/docs/swap/get-quote).

## Prepare Transaction

<Note>
  **WHO IS THE SIGNER?**

  The most important part of this step is to sign the transaction. For the sake of the guide, you will be using the file system wallet you have set up to sign and send yourself.

  However, for other production scenarios such as building your own program or app on top of the Legacy Swap API, you will need the user to be the signer which is often through a third party wallet provider, so do account for it.
</Note>

In the previous guide, we are able to get the `swapTransaction` from the Legacy Swap API response. However, you will need to reformat it to sign and send the transaction, here are the formats to note of.

| Formats                      | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Serialized Uint8array format | The correct format to send to the network.                                                                                                  |
| Serialized base64 format     | This is a text encoding of the Uint8array data, meant for transport like our Legacy Swap API or storage. You should not sign this directly. |
| Deserialized format          | This is the human-readable, object-like format before serialization. This is the state you will sign the transaction.                       |

Here's the code to deserialize and sign, then serialize.

1. `swapTransaction` from the Legacy Swap API is a serialized transaction in the **base64 format**.
2. Convert it to **Uint8array (binary buffer) format**.
3. Deserialize it to a **VersionedTransaction** object to sign.
4. Finally, convert it back to **Uint8array** format to send the transaction.

```js  theme={null}
const transactionBase64 = swapResponse.swapTransaction
const transaction = VersionedTransaction.deserialize(Buffer.from(transactionBase64, 'base64'));
console.log(transaction);

transaction.sign([wallet]);

const transactionBinary = transaction.serialize();
console.log(transactionBinary);
```

<Tip>
  **BLOCKHASH VALIDITY**

  If you look at the response of `console.log(transaction);`, you can see that our backend has already handled the blockhash and last valid block height in your transaction.

  The validity of a blockhash typically lasts for 150 slots, but you can manipulate this to reduce the validity of a transaction, resulting in faster failures which could be useful in certain scenarios.

  <Card title="Read more about transaction expiry here." href="https://solana.com/docs/advanced/confirmation#transaction-expiration" icon="book-open" horizontal />
</Tip>

## Send Transaction

### Transaction Sending Options

Finally, there are a 2 [transaction sending options](https://solana.com/docs/advanced/retry#an-in-depth-look-at-sendtransaction) that we should take note of. Depending on your use case, these options can make a big difference to you or your users. For example, if you are using the Legacy Swap API as a payment solution, setting higher `maxRetries` allows the transaction to have more retries as it is not as critical compared to a bot that needs to catch fast moving markets.

<Accordion title="Transaction Sending Options">
  | Options                                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
  | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | [maxRetries](https://solana.com/docs/advanced/retry)                                   | Maximum number of times for the RPC node to retry sending the transaction to the leader. If this parameter is not provided, the RPC node will retry the transaction until it is finalized or until the blockhash expires. |
  | [skipPreflight](https://solana.com/docs/advanced/retry#the-cost-of-skipping-preflight) | If true, skip the preflight transaction checks (default: false). - Verify that all signatures are valid.                                                                                                                  |

  * Check that the referenced blockhash is within the last 150 blocks.
  * Simulate the transaction against the bank slot specified by the preflightCommitment. |
</Accordion>

```js  theme={null}
const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(transactionBinary, {
    maxRetries: 2,
    skipPreflight: true
});
```

### Transaction Confirmation

In addition, after sending the transaction, it is always a best practice to check the transaction confirmation state, and if not, log the error for debugging or communicating with your users on your interface.

<Card title="Read more about transaction confirmation tips here." href="https://solana.com/docs/advanced/confirmation#transaction-confirmation-tips" icon="book-open" horizontal />

```js  theme={null}
const confirmation = await connection.confirmTransaction({signature,}, "finalized");

if (confirmation.value.err) {
    throw new Error(`Transaction failed: ${JSON.stringify(confirmation.value.err)}\nhttps://solscan.io/tx/${signature}/`);
} else console.log(`Transaction successful: https://solscan.io/tx/${signature}/`);
```

## Swap Transaction Executed!

If you have followed the guides step by step without missing a beat, your transaction *should* theoretically land and you can view the link in console log to see the [transaction](https://solscan.io/tx/zEWGsd5tSyxUdsTn27hUzaJBadQSiFxF2X1CxVdQzdtgc3BpqyDPf5VQCFUScidhHJP5PchY33oJ3tZJLK5KXrf).

## Oh? Transaction Not Landing?

As the Solana network grew and increased in activity over the years, it has become more challenging to land transactions. There are several factors that can drastically affect the success of your transaction:

* Setting competitive priority fee
* Setting accurate amount of compute units
* Managing slippage effectively
* Broadcasting transaction efficiently
* Other tips

### How Jupiter Estimates Priority Fee?

You can pass in `prioritizationFeeLamports` to Legacy Swap API where our backend will estimate the Priority Fee for you.

We are using [Triton’s `getRecentPrioritizationFees`](https://docs.triton.one/chains/solana/improved-priority-fees-api) to estimate using the local fee market in writable accounts of the transaction (comparing to the global fee market), across the past 20 slots and categorizing them into different percentiles.

<Card title="Read More About Priority Fee" href="https://solana.com/docs/core/fees#prioritization-fees" icon="book-open" horizontal />

| Parameters      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maxLamports`   | A maximum cap applied if the estimated priority fee is too high. This is helpful when you have users using your application and can be a safety measure to prevent overpaying.                               |
| `global`        | A boolean to choose between using a global or local fee market to estimate. If `global` is set to `false`, the estimation focuses on fees relevant to the **writable accounts** involved in the instruction. |
| `priorityLevel` | A setting to choose between the different percentile levels. Higher percentile will have better transaction landing but also incur higher fees. - `medium`: 25th percentile                                  |

* `high`: 50th percentile
* `veryHigh`: 75th percentile |

```js  theme={null}
const swapResponse = await (
  await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/swap', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
          quoteResponse,
          userPublicKey: wallet.publicKey,
          prioritizationFeeLamports: {
              priorityLevelWithMaxLamports: {
                  maxLamports: 10000000,
                  global: false,
                  priorityLevel: "veryHigh"
              }
          }
      })
  })
).json();
```

### How Jupiter Estimates Compute Unit Limit?

You can pass in `dynamicComputeUnitLimit` to Legacy Swap API where our backend will estimate the Compute Unit Limit for you.

When `true`, it allows the transaction to utilize a dynamic compute unit rather than using incorrect compute units which can be detrimental to transaction prioritization. Additionally, the amount of compute unit used and the compute unit limit requested to be used are correlated to the amount of priority fees you pay.

<Card title="Read more about Compute Budget, Compute Unit, etc here." href="https://solana.com/docs/core/fees#compute-budget" icon="book-open" horizontal />

```js  theme={null}
const swapTransaction = await (
  await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/swap', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      quoteResponse,
      userPublicKey: wallet.publicKey,
      dynamicComputeUnitLimit: true
    })
  })
).json();
```

### How Jupiter Estimates Slippage?

Slippage is an unavoidable aspect of trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXes).

#### About Slippage

* **Token Pair:** The same fixed slippage setting can have very different effects depending on the tokens involved. For example, swapping between two stablecoins is much less volatile than swapping between two meme coins.
* **Timing:** The time between when you receive a quote and when you actually send the swap transaction matters. Any delay can result in the price moving outside your slippage threshold.
* **Transaction Landing:** How efficiently your transaction lands on-chain also affects slippage. Poorly optimized transactions may experience more slippage.

<Tip>
  - If you use the Legacy Swap API:

    * You are limited to fixed and dynamic slippage (no longer maintained) settings.
    * You are responsible for handling slippage and optimizing transaction landing yourself.

  - [Alternatively, consider using the Ultra Swap API](/docs/ultra):

    * All of these optimizations are handled for you - without any RPC from you.
    * Additional routing is available to RFQ (Request for Quote) systems like Jupiterz where slippage is not an issue because the market maker fills your order exactly as quoted.
</Tip>

#### Dynamic Slippage

Apart from the fixed slippage setting, you can use Dynamic Slippage: During swap transaction building, we will simulate the transaction and estimate a slippage value, which we then factor in the token categories heuristics to get the final slippage value.

<Note>
  **DYNAMIC SLIPPAGE VS REAL TIME SLIPPAGE ESTIMATOR (RTSE)**

  RTSE is very different from Dynamic Slippage and has provided a much better user experience and results. RTSE is able to intelligently estimate the best possible slippage to use at the time of execution, balancing between trade success and price protection. RTSE uses a variety of heuristics, algorithms and monitoring to ensure the best user experience:

  * **Heuristics**: Token categories, historical and real-time slippage data, and more.
  * **Algorithms**: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on slippage data, and more.
  * **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of failure rates to ensure reactiveness to increase slippage when necessary.

  <Card title="Refer to Ultra Swap API for more information on RTSE" href="/docs/ultra#real-time-slippage-estimator" icon="book-open" horizontal />
</Note>

<Warning>
  **WARNING**

  Do note that we have discontinued development on Dynamic Slippage.
</Warning>

```js  theme={null}
const swapTransaction = await (
  await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/swap/v1/swap', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      quoteResponse,
      userPublicKey: wallet.publicKey,
      dynamicSlippage: true,
    })
  })
).json();
```

### How Jupiter Broadcast Transactions?

Transaction broadcasting is the process of submitting a signed transaction to the network so that validators can verify, process, and include it in a block.

#### Broadcasting Through RPCs

After you’ve built and signed your transaction, the signed transaction is serialized into a binary format and sent to the network via a Solana RPC node. The RPC node will verify and relay the transaction to the leader validator responsible for producing the next block.

<Card title="Read more about how RPC nodes broadcast transactions." href="https://solana.com/docs/advanced/retry#how-rpc-nodes-broadcast-transactions" icon="book-open" horizontal />

This is the most typical method to send transactions to the network to get executed. It is simple but you need to make sure the transactions are:

* Send in the serialized transaction format.

* Use fresh blockhash and last valid blockheight.

* Use optimal amount of priority fees and compute unit limit.

* Free of error.

* Utilize retries.

* Configure your RPCs

  * Optional but you can send your transaction to a staked RPC endpoint also known as [Stake-Weighted Quality of Service (SWQoS)](https://solana.com/developers/guides/advanced/stake-weighted-qos).
  * Used dedicated RPC services versus free or shared, depending on how critical your usage is.
  * Propagate to multiple RPC rather than reliant on one.

#### Broadcasting Through Jito

To include Jito Tips in your Legacy Swap transaction, you can do specify in the Legacy Swap API parameters. However, please take note of these when sending your transaction to Jito and [you can find thsese information in their documentation](https://docs.jito.wtf/):

* You need to submit to a Jito RPC endpoint for it to work.
* You need to send an appropriate amount of Jito Tip to be included to be processed.

<Info>
  **MORE ABOUT JITO**

  You can leverage [Jito](https://www.jito.wtf/) to send transactions via tips for faster inclusion and better outcomes. Similar to Priority Fees, Jito Tips incentivize the inclusion of transaction bundles during block production, enhancing users' chances of securing critical transactions in competitive scenarios.

  Additionally, Jito enables bundling transactions to ensure they execute together or not at all, helping protect against front-running and other MEV risks through “revert protection” if any part of the sequence fails, all while reducing transaction latency for timely execution.

  <Card title="Read more about how Jito works and other details here." href="https://docs.jito.wtf/lowlatencytxnsend/#system-overview" icon="book-open" horizontal />

        jitoTipLamports: 1000000 // note that this is FIXED LAMPORTS not a max cap
      }

# Organic Score
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/tokens/organic-score

Understand how Organic Score is derived and how it is used to measure the genuine activity and health of a token.

Organic Score is a metric designed to measure the genuine activity and health of a token. Unlike traditional metrics that can be easily manipulated by artificial trading or bot activity, the Organic Score focuses on real user participation and authentic market metrics. This helps users, developers, and projects better understand the context of similar tokens and find the signal within the noise.

## How Organic Score is Derived

Organic Score is derived from a set of core metrics, such as holder count, trading volume and liquidity. In order to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the score, we track the metrics participated by real user wallets (not bots, etc) in real time to derive the Organic Score.

<Note>
  **ORGANIC SCORE**

  This is a high level depiction of how Organic Score is dervied, there are other heuristics and data involved to measure and derive it.

# Token Tag Standard
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/tokens/token-tag-standard

Use the token tag standard to get your tokens tagged for better visibility on Jupiter UI or via the Tokens API.

The Tokens API is built with a tagging system such as Verified, LSTs and more. In this section, we will be going through how you can get your tokens tagged for better visibility on Jupiter UI or via the Tokens API.

## Requirements

* [An endpoint that points to a .csv file with a mint address per row](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jup-ag/token-list/main/examples/sample_tags.csv).
* A preferred word or acronym for your tag - one that's short and mobile friendly.
* A set interval for us to poll.

The endpoint should be public, with our IP whitelisted for rate limits where necessary.

## How to get your tokens tagged

After you have completed the requirements, please reach out to us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/jup).

Once we start ingesting your list, the tokens will be tagged automatically.


# s API V1 (Deprecated)

<Warning>
  **DEPRECATED**

  [Tokens API V1](/docs/tokens/v1) will be/is deprecated by 30th September 2025.

  Please migrate to [Tokens API V2](/docs/tokens/v2) which consists of breaking changes.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  Base URL: `https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v1`

  For higher rate limits, [refer to the API Key Setup doc](/portal/setup).
</Info>

## Get Token Information

Using this endpoint, you can get the token information of the specific mint address. In the following example, we are looking at getting the token information of the JUP token.

<Tip>
  **USEFUL MINT INFORMATION**

  In the response, you can see that we have identified the `tags`, [`freeze_authority`](https://spl.solana.com/token#freezing-accounts) and [`permanent_delegate`](https://spl.solana.com/token#authority-delegation) to help you or your users make informed decisions.
</Tip>

```js  theme={null}
const tokenInfoResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v1/token/JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN')
).json();

console.log(tokenInfoResponse);
```

From the above example, you should see this response.

```js  theme={null}
{
    address: 'JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN',
    name: 'Jupiter',
    symbol: 'JUP',
    decimals: 6,
    logoURI: 'https://static.jup.ag/jup/icon.png',
    tags: [ 'verified', 'strict', 'community', 'birdeye-trending' ],

    minted_at: '2024-01-25T08:54:23Z',
    extensions: { coingeckoId: 'jupiter-exchange-solana' }
}
```

## Get Tokens In Market

Using this endpoint, you can get a list of token mints that belong to a market/pool address. In the following example, we use a [Meteora SOL-USDC market](https://solscan.io/account/BVRbyLjjfSBcoyiYFuxbgKYnWuiFaF9CSXEa5vdSZ9Hh).

```js  theme={null}
const marketTokensResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v1/market/BVRbyLjjfSBcoyiYFuxbgKYnWuiFaF9CSXEa5vdSZ9Hh/mints')
).json();

console.log(marketTokensResponse);
```

From the above example, you should see this response.

```js  theme={null}
[
    'So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112',
    'EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v'
]
```

## Get All Tradable Tokens

Using this endpoint, you can get a list of all token mints that are tradable on Jupiter.

* A new token (before market liquidity checks)
* Or tokens that has past the market liquidity checks
* These tokens should return a quote from the `/quote` endpoint and is able to swap.

```js  theme={null}
const allTradableResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v1/mints/tradable')
).json();

console.log(allTradableResponse);
```

From the above example, you should see this response.

```js  theme={null}
[
    ...

    'So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112',
    'EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v'
    'jupSoLaHXQiZZTSfEWMTRRgpnyFm8f6sZdosWBjx93v',

    '27G8MtK7VtTcCHkpASjSDdkWWYfoqT6ggEuKidVJidD4',

    ...
]
```

## Get Tagged Tokens

Using this endpoint, you can get a list of token mints (with information) that are tagged according to the tag you pass in. In the following example, we use the `lst` tag.

<Tip>
  **TIP**

  A list of useful tags are:

  | **Token List Name** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                    |
  | :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **verified**        | A list of verified tokens, consisting of community-verified tokens via [catdetlist.jup.ag](https://catdetlist.jup.ag) and the previous standard of Jupiter Strict. |

  | **token-2022**      | A list of all token-2022 tokens.                                                                                                                                   |

  You can pass in multiple tags using a comma separated list, refer to the API Reference for more details.
</Tip>

```js  theme={null}
const lstTaggedResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v1/tagged/lst')
).json();

console.log(lstTaggedResponse);
```

From the above example, you should see this response.

```js  theme={null}
...

{
    address: 'jupSoLaHXQiZZTSfEWMTRRgpnyFm8f6sZdosWBjx93v',
    name: 'Jupiter Staked SOL',
    symbol: 'JupSOL',
    decimals: 9,
    logoURI: 'https://static.jup.ag/jupSOL/icon.png',
    tags: [ 'verified', 'community', 'strict', 'lst' ],
    daily_volume: 24017778.687489692,
    created_at: '2024-04-26T10:57:45.759228Z',

    extensions: { coingeckoId: 'jupiter-staked-sol' }
},

...
```

## Get New Tokens

Using this endpoint, you can get a list of token mints (with information) **sorted by `created_at` their timestamps**.

<Tip>
  **PAGINATE LARGE RESPONSE**

  The `/new` endpoint will return a large sized payload as response, you can utilize the `limit` and `offset` query parameters to help paginate the responses.

  * `limit`: Refers to how many counts of data to be in the output.
  * `offset`: Refers to how many counts of data to offset into the result set.
    * Used in conjunction with `limit` to page through the data.
</Tip>

```js  theme={null}
const newTokensReponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v1/new')
).json();

console.log(newTokensReponse);
```

From the above example, you should see this response.

```js  theme={null}
{
    mint: 'penguin',
    created_at: '1733481083',
    metadata_updated_at: 1733481087,
    name: 'cool penguin',
    symbol: 'penguin',
    decimals: 6,
    logo_uri: 'https://jup.ag',
    known_markets: [ 'market' ],
    mint_authority: null,
    freeze_authority: null
},
{
    mint: 'cat',
    created_at: '1733481083',
    metadata_updated_at: 1733481087,
    name: 'cat moon',
    symbol: 'cat',
    decimals: 6,
    logo_uri: 'https://jup.ag',
    known_markets: [ 'market' ],
    mint_authority: null,
    freeze_authority: null
},
```

## Get All Tokens

Using the endpoint, you can simply query with the `all` resource to get all tokens that Jupiter has indexed through our infrastructure.

<Warning>
  **WARNING**

  Do note that calling this endpoint's resource will return **a large payload of 300+MB**, which would introduce some latency in the call. Please use carefully and intentionally, else utilize the other endpoints.

  This endpoint does not support `limit` or `offset`.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **TIP**

  To index your own tokens, you can use RPC APIs such as the [Metaplex Digital Asset Standard (DAS)](https://developers.metaplex.com/das-api). Major RPC providers like [Helius](https://docs.helius.dev/compression-and-das-api/digital-asset-standard-das-api) and [Triton One](https://docs.triton.one/digital-assets-api/introduction) offer access to this API.
</Tip>

```js  theme={null}
const allResponse = await (
  await fetch("https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v1/all")
).json();

console.log(allResponse);
```

From the above example, you should see this response.

```js  theme={null}

    <Card title="API Rate Limit" href="/portal/rate-limit" icon="gauge" horizontal />
  </CardGroup>
</Info>

<Tip>
  **USEFUL MINT INFORMATION**

  * Token Metadata like name, symbol, icon to display token information to users
  * [Organic Score](/docs/tokens/organic-score), Holder count, Market cap, etc can be useful to help make a better trading decision
  * And much more!

  Do note that the response is subject to changes as we continue to improve.

  Refer to [Example Response](#example-response) or [Tokens API V2 Reference](/api-reference/tokens/v2) for full schema.
</Tip>

## Query by Mint

The Tokens API V2 provides an endpoint to search tokens in the background for you and returns you the search results, along with the mint information.

This is useful in most user applications, as users need to choose which tokens they want to swap. This also provides a seamless developer experience as integrating this allows us to handle and abstract the token search mechanism, allowing you to focus on other user features.

<Tip>
  **SEARCH**

  * Search for a token and its information by its **symbol, name or mint address**.
  * Comma-separate to search for multiple.
  * Limit to 100 mint addresses in query.
  * Default to 20 mints in response when searching via symbol or name.
</Tip>

```js  theme={null}
const searchResponse = await (
  await fetch(`https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v2/search?query=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112`)
).json();
```

## Query by Tag

The Tokens API V2 provides an endpoint to query by tags. This is useful to help users distinguish between verified vs non-verified or specific groups of tokens like liquid-staked tokens (LSTs).

<Tip>
  **TAGS**

  * Only `lst` or `verified` tag.
  * Note that this will return the entire array of existing mints that belongs to the tag.
</Tip>

```js  theme={null}
const tagResponse = await (
  await fetch(`https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v2/tag?query=verified`)
).json();
```

## Get Category

The Tokens API V2 provides an endpoint to get mints and their mint information by categories. These categories are useful for identifying tokens in specific trading scenarios, providing users with more information to trade with.

<Tip>
  **CATEGORY**

  * Only `toporganicscore`, `toptraded` or `toptrending` category.
  * Added query by interval for more accuracy, using `5m`, `1h`, `6h`, `24h`.
  * The result filters out generic top tokens like SOL, USDC, etc (since those tokens are likely always top of the categories).
  * Default to 50 mints in response (use `limit` to increase or decrease number of results).
</Tip>

```js  theme={null}
const categoryResponse = await (
  await fetch(`https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v2/toporganicscore/5m?limit=100`)
).json();
```

## Get Recent

The Tokens API V2 provides an endpoint to get mints and their mint information by their recency. This is helpful to display to users a list of tokens that just had their first pool created, providing more information to trade with.

<Tip>
  **RECENT**

  * Do note that the definition of RECENT is the **token's first pool creation time** (and not token's mint/creation timestamp).
  * Default to 30 mints in response.
</Tip>

```js  theme={null}
const recentResponse = await (
  await fetch(`https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v2/recent`)
).json();
```

## Example Response

All endpoints will return an array of mints, along with their information.

# Best Practices
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/trigger/best-practices

Some best practices when using the Trigger API.

| Item                                                                                                  | Recommendation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The program will accept any value to create an order.                                                 | On jup.ag, our frontend enforces a minimum of 5 USD per order to be created, this will ensure our keepers can accommodate for no loss in transaction fees coverage. However, programmatically, if you do not enforce this, the user can still create an order.                                                                                                                                |
| The program does not check the price or rate of the order, and the keeper will execute as instructed. | On our frontend, when user attempts to set the rate to buy above market price, we provide warnings and disable the execution if above 5%. If the order is created with such rates, the keeper will execute as instructed. For example, if user sets to Sell 1000 USDC to Buy 1 SOL at the rate of 1000 SOL/USDC, the keeper will execute as instructed and the additional funds will be lost. |
| Tokens with transfer tax extension are disabled.                                                      | Our frontend informs the user if the token has transfer tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Token2022 tokens with transfer tax extension are disabled.                                            | Our frontend informs the user if the token has transfer tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  * Lite URL: `https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/cancelOrder`
  * Pro URL: `https://api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/cancelOrder`

  To upgrade to Pro or understand our rate limiting, please refer to this section.

    <Card title="API Key Setup" href="/portal/setup" icon="key" horizontal />

    <Card title="API Rate Limit" href="/portal/rate-limit" icon="gauge" horizontal />
  </CardGroup>
</Info>

If you want to cancel order(s), you need to do these steps:

1. Get a list of the order accounts you want to cancel via `/getTriggerOrders` endpoint.
2. Use the list of order accounts to make a post request to the `/cancelOrder` endpoint to get the transaction to cancel one or multiple orders.
3. Sign then send the transaction to the network either via `/execute` endpoint or by yourself.

<Note>
  **GET TRIGGER ORDERS**

  [Refer to the `/getTriggerOrders` section](/docs/trigger/get-trigger-orders) to prepare the list of order accounts you want to cancel.
</Note>

<Info>
  **INFO**

  To cancel multiple orders, you can use the [`/cancelOrders` endpoint](#cancel-orders) to pass in a list of order accounts and it will build the transaction for multiple cancellations.
</Info>

## Cancel Order

```js  theme={null}
const cancelOrderResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/cancelOrder', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            maker: "jdocuPgEAjMfihABsPgKEvYtsmMzjUHeq9LX4Hvs7f3",
            computeUnitPrice: "auto",
            order: "3g2jF8txqXPp6GUStwtXMrWydeYWxU4qoBA8UDLoTnK7",
        })
    })
).json();
```

## Cancel Order Response

**Success Example Response**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "transaction": "AQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......QYHAwUIX4Ht8Agx34Q=",
  "requestId": "370100dd-1a85-421b-9278-27f0961ae5f4",
}
```

**Failed Example Response**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "error": "no matching orders found",
  "code": 400
}
```

## Cancel Orders

<Warning>
  **WARNING**

  If no orders are specified, the API will return the transaction to cancel **ALL** open orders, batched in groups of 5 orders.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **TIP**

  Orders are batched in groups of 5, if you have 6 orders to cancel, you will receive 2 transactions.

  Do note that you will receive a list of transactions, so you will need to access each transaction in it to sign and send individually.

  If using `/execute` endpoint, you should pass in the same `requestId` for the different transactions.
</Tip>

```js  theme={null}
const cancelOrdersResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/cancelOrders', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            maker: "jdocuPgEAjMfihABsPgKEvYtsmMzjUHeq9LX4Hvs7f3",
            computeUnitPrice: "auto",
            orders: [

```


# Create Order
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/trigger/create-order



<Warning>
  **NEW PATHS**

  The `/limit/v2` path will be deprecated soon, please update your API calls to use the `/trigger/v1` path immediately.

  When updating to the new path, please refer to the documentation as there are some breaking changes.

  * `/execute` endpoint is introduced.
  * `/createOrder` endpoint now includes an additional `requestId` parameter to be used with the `/execute` endpoint.
  * `/cancelOrder` endpoint only builds the transaction for 1 order, while `/cancelOrders` endpoint builds the transaction for multiple orders.
  * The `tx` field in the responses are now `transaction` or `transactions`.
  * `/getTriggerOrders` endpoint is introduced to get either active or historical orders (based on the query parameters) in a new format.
</Warning>

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  * Lite URL: `https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/createOrder`
  * Pro URL: `https://api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/createOrder`

  To upgrade to Pro or understand our rate limiting, please refer to this section.

    <Card title="API Rate Limit" href="/portal/rate-limit" icon="gauge" horizontal />
  </CardGroup>
</Info>

## Create Order

This is a POST request to `/createOrder` endpoint, where you pass in the necessary parameters and our backend will create the transaction for you to sign and send to the network seamlessly.

<Tip>
  **OPTIONAL PARAMETERS**

  Do note that there are a few optional parameters that you can use, such as:

  * Adding slippage to the order: This corresponds to the "Ultra" mode on jup.ag frontend. Higher slippage increases execution success rate but may result in less favorable prices. Omitting this parameter (or setting it to 0) corresponds to "Exact" mode. [Learn more about UI modes vs API implementation](/docs/trigger#faq).
  * Setting an expiry date on the order.
  * Adding fees through our referral program, please ensure that your `feeAccount` has the necessary `referralTokenAccount`s of the output mint of the limit order for it to work, you can learn more about creating them dynamically in the [Add Fees To Swap](/docs/swap/add-fees-to-swap#for-trigger-api-integrator-fee) guide. (Note that the fees are transferred only after the trigger order has been executed.)
</Tip>

**Create a POST request to the `/createOrder` endpoint.**

```js  theme={null}
const createOrderResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/createOrder', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            inputMint: inputMint.toString(),
            outputMint: outputMint.toString(),
            maker: "jdocuPgEAjMfihABsPgKEvYtsmMzjUHeq9LX4Hvs7f3",
            payer: "jdocuPgEAjMfihABsPgKEvYtsmMzjUHeq9LX4Hvs7f3",
            params: {
                makingAmount: "1000000",
                takingAmount: "300000",
                // slippageBps: "", // Optional, by nature, trigger orders execute with 0 slippage
                // expiredAt: "", // In unix seconds (e.g. Date.now()/1_000) or optional
                // feeBps: "", // Requires referral account or optional
            },
            computeUnitPrice: "auto",
            // feeAccount: "", // Optional but if specified it is the referral token account of the output mint
            // wrapAndUnwrapSol: true, // Default true or optional
        })
    })
).json();

console.log(createOrderResponse);
```

Now that you have the order transaction, you can sign and send to the network. There are 2 methods, after signing the transaction, you can either send it to the network yourself or use the Trigger API's `/execute` endpoint to do it for you.

## Create Order Response

**Success Example Response**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "order": "CFG9Bmppz7eZbna96UizACJPYT3UgVgps3KkMNNo6P4k",
  "transaction": "AQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AgAKCAkBAQsPAAADBAEMCwcKCQkIBg0LIoVuSq9wn/WfdskdmHlfUulAQg8AAAAAAICpAwAAAAAAAAAJAwEAAAEJAA==",
  "requestId": "370100dd-1a85-421b-9278-27f0961ae5f4"

**Failed Example Response**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "error": "invalid create order request",
  "cause": "input mint making amount must be at least 5 USD, received: 2",
  "code": 400
}
```


# Execute Order
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/trigger/execute-order



<Info>
  **NOTE**

  * Lite URL: `https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/execute`
  * Pro URL: `https://api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/execute`

  To upgrade to Pro or understand our rate limiting, please refer to this section.

  <CardGroup>
    <Card title="API Key Setup" href="/portal/setup" icon="key" horizontal />

    <Card title="API Rate Limit" href="/portal/rate-limit" icon="gauge" horizontal />
  </CardGroup>
</Info>

After getting the order transaction, you can sign and send to the network yourself or use the Trigger API's `/execute` endpoint to do it for you.

## Sign Transaction

Using the Solana `web3.js` v1 library, you can sign the transaction as follows:

```js  theme={null}
// ... GET /order's response

// Extract the transaction from the order response
const transactionBase64 = orderResponse.tx

// Deserialize the transaction
const transaction = VersionedTransaction.deserialize(Buffer.from(transactionBase64, 'base64'));

// Sign the transaction
transaction.sign([wallet]);

// Serialize the transaction to base64 format
const signedTransaction = Buffer.from(transaction.serialize()).toString('base64');
```

## Execute Order

By making a post request to the `/execute` endpoint, Jupiter executes the order transaction on behalf of you/your users. This includes handling of transaction handling, priority fees, RPC connection, etc.

```js  theme={null}
const executeResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/execute', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            signedTransaction: signedTransaction,
            requestId: "370100dd-1a85-421b-9278-27f0961ae5f4",
        }),
    })
).json();
```

## Execute Order Response

After making the post request to the `/execute` endpoint, you will receive a response with the status of the order.

**Example response of successful order:**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "signature": "...",
  "status": "Success"
}
```

**Example response of failed order:**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "error": "custom program error code: 1",
  "code": 500,
  "signature": "...",
  "status": "Failed"
}
```

## Send Transaction Yourself

If you want to handle the transaction, you can sign and send the transaction to the network yourself.

```js expandable theme={null}
const transactionBase64 = createOrderResponse.transaction
const transaction = VersionedTransaction.deserialize(Buffer.from(transactionBase64, 'base64'));

transaction.sign([wallet]);

const transactionBinary = transaction.serialize();

const blockhashInfo = await connection.getLatestBlockhashAndContext({ commitment: "finalized" });

const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(transactionBinary, {
    maxRetries: 1,
    skipPreflight: true
});

const confirmation = await connection.confirmTransaction({
signature,
blockhash: blockhashInfo.value.blockhash,
lastValidBlockHeight: blockhashInfo.value.lastValidBlockHeight,
}, "finalized");

if (confirmation.value.err) {
    throw new Error(`Transaction failed: ${JSON.stringify(confirmation.value.err)}\n\nhttps://solscan.io/tx/${signature}`);
} else console.log(`Transaction successful: https://solscan.io/tx/${signature}`);
```


# Get Trigger Orders
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/trigger/get-trigger-orders



<Info>
  **NOTE**

  * Lite URL: `https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/getTriggerOrders`
  * Pro URL: `https://api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/getTriggerOrders`

  To upgrade to Pro or understand our rate limiting, please refer to this section.

    <Card title="API Key Setup" href="/portal/setup" icon="key" horizontal />

    <Card title="API Rate Limit" href="/portal/rate-limit" icon="gauge" horizontal />
  </CardGroup>
</Info>

This is a GET request to `/getTriggerOrders` endpoint.

The response is paginated for every 10 orders and you can view different pages using the `page` parameter. The `hasMoreData` boolean will indicate if you have more data in the next page.

<Warning>
  **CHANGE OF RESPONSE FORMAT**

  The `/getTriggerOrders` endpoint does not provide the same data format as the old `orderHistory` or `openOrders` endpoint.
</Warning>

## Active Orders

To get the active orders, you can pass in the `orderStatus` parameter as `active`.

<Tip>
  You can optionally pass in the input and output token mint addresses to filter the open orders.
</Tip>

```js  theme={null}
const openOrdersResponse = await (
    await fetch(
        'https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/getTriggerOrders?user=jdocuPgEAjMfihABsPgKEvYtsmMzjUHeq9LX4Hvs7f3&orderStatus=active'
    )
).json();
```

## Order History

To get the order history, you can pass in the `orderStatus` parameter as `history`.

```js  theme={null}
const orderHistoryResponse = await (
    await fetch(
        'https://lite-api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/getTriggerOrders?user=ErJKdNoarixqGGQTHbBtvHtg2nkcCqcKtYjGbVKUxY7D&orderStatus=history'
    )
).json();
```


# About Trigger API
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/trigger/index



The Jupiter Trigger API enables you to create limit orders on Solana, allowing users to set target prices for token swaps that execute automatically when market conditions are met.

The Trigger API is ideal for:

* DeFi applications that want to offer users more advanced trading options
* Wallets looking to expand their trading features
* Automated systems that need to execute at specific price points

## Features

| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Custom integrator fees** | Integrators can choose to charge their own custom fees (on top of Jupiter's fees).                          |
| **Any token pair**         | Create trigger orders between any token pairs supported on Jupiter's Metis Routing Engine.                  |
| **Best execution**         | Orders are executed through Jupiter's Metis Routing Engine to get the best possible price across all DEXes. |
| **Price monitoring**       | Our infrastructure continuously monitors prices to execute trigger orders as soon as conditions are met.    |
| **Order expiry**           | Trigger orders can be set to expire after a certain period of time.                                         |
| **Slippage addition**      | Add slippage to the target price, ideal for users who want to prioritize success rate over price.           |

    The Ultra Swap Integrator Fees are governed by the [Referral Program](/tool-kits/referral-program).

    It is required to create a valid **referral account** and it's **referral token accounts** for the specific token mints to collect fees in. These accounts are initalized under the [**Jupiter Ultra Referral Project**](https://solscan.io/account/DkiqsTrw1u1bYFumumC7sCG2S8K25qc2vemJFHyW2wJc).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="`feeMint` is decided by Ultra Swap">
    In the `/order` response, you will see the `feeMint` field which is the token mint we will collect the fees in for that particular order.

    Since Jupiter will always dictate which token mint to collect the fees in, you must ensure that you have the valid referral token account created for the specific fee mint.

    <Info>
      The `feeMint` is based on a priority list, you can refer to this [JSON file for the list](https://github.com/jup-ag/dynamic-slippage-config/blob/main/token_categories.json).

      For example,

      * If the `inputMint=SOL` and the `outputMint=USDC`, the `feeMint` will be `SOL`, as it is of highest priority.
      * If the `inputMint=USDC` and the `outputMint=SOL`, the `feeMint` will be `SOL`, as it is of highest priority, regardless of side.
      * If the `inputMint=MEME` and the `outputMint=USDC`, the `feeMint` will be `USDC`, as the stablecoin has higher priority.
    </Info>

    <Warning>
      If the `referralTokenAccount` for the `feeMint` is not initialized, the order will still return and can be executed without your fees. This is to ensure your user still receives a quote to proceed with the swap.

      For example, if the `feeMint` is `SOL`, but the `referralTokenAccount` for `SOL` is not initialized, the order will still return and can be executed without your fees.

      You can refer to if `feeBps` tallies with what you specified in `referralFee`, in this case, the `feeBps` will default to Jupiter Ultra's default fees.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integrator fee split">
    By default, Jupiter Ultra Swap incurs a 5 to 10 bps fee based on token mint.

    When you add integrator fee, Jupiter will take a flat 20% of your integrator fees.

    For example, if you plan to take 100bps, Jupiter will take 20bps for the fee split (there will be no Ultra base fee).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check the `feeBps` field">
    You can configure `referralFee` to be between 50bps to 255bps. The `/order` response will show the total fee in `feeBps` field which should be exactly what you specified in `referralFee`.

    Do note that, the referral token account has to be created before calling `/order` because during the request, we will check if the token account is initialized before applying your referral fee (if it is not applied, we will only apply our default fees).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token support">
    You can now take fees in SPL or Token2022 tokens. As long as you have the referral token account initialized before calling `/order`, and the `feeMint` is one of the token mints you have initialized for, your fees will apply.

    * For example, if you have the referral token account initialized for `SOL` only and the `feeMint` is `SOL`, your fees will be applied.
    * If you have the referral token account initialized for `USDC` only and the `feeMint` is `USDC`, your fees will be applied.
    * If you have the referral token account initialized for `XYZ` only BUT the `feeMint` is `USDC`, your fees will not be applied.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="JupiterZ does not support Integrator Fees">
    JupiterZ does not support integrator fees and it will not be routed when referral params are passed in to get an order.

### Dependencies

```bash  theme={null}
npm install @jup-ag/referral-sdk
npm install @solana/web3.js@1 # Using v1 of web3.js instead of v2
```

<Accordion title="RPC Connection and Wallet Setup">
  **Set up RPC Connection**

  <Info>
    Solana provides a [default RPC endpoint](https://solana.com/docs/core/clusters). However, as your application grows, we recommend you to always use your own or provision a 3rd party provider’s RPC endpoint such as [Helius](https://helius.dev/) or [Triton](https://triton.one/).
  </Info>

  ```bash  theme={null}
  const connection = new Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');
  ```

  **Set up Development Wallet**

  <Info>
    You can paste in your private key for testing but this is not recommended for production.

    * Either use your private key in the project directly, you can do it via a `.env` file.
    * Or set up your private key in the [Solana CLI](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation#create-wallet).
  </Info>

  <CodeGroup>
    ```javascript Store private key in .env theme={null}
    // In your .env file
    PRIVATE_KEY=""

    // In your index.js (or any file that needs the private key)
    import { Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
    import dotenv from 'dotenv';
    require('dotenv').config();

    const wallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(bs58.decode(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY || '')));
    ```

    ```javascript Store private key in Solana CLI theme={null}
    import { Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
    import fs from 'fs';

    const privateKeyArray = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/Path/to/.config/solana/id.json', 'utf8').trim());
    const wallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(privateKeyArray));
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

### Create `referralAccount`

* You should only need to create the referral account once.
* After this step, you need to [create the referral token accounts for each token mint](#create-referraltokenaccount).

```js expandable theme={null}
import { ReferralProvider } from "@jup-ag/referral-sdk";
import { Connection, Keypair, PublicKey, sendAndConfirmTransaction } from "@solana/web3.js";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
const privateKeyArray = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/Path/to/.config/solana/id.json', 'utf8').trim());
const wallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(privateKeyArray));
const provider = new ReferralProvider(connection);
const projectPubKey = new PublicKey('DkiqsTrw1u1bYFumumC7sCG2S8K25qc2vemJFHyW2wJc'); // Jupiter Ultra Referral Project

async function initReferralAccount() {

  } else {
    console.log(
      `referralAccount ${transaction.referralAccountPubKey.toBase58()} already exists`,
    );
  }
}
```

### Create `referralTokenAccount`

* You need to [create the `referralAccount` first](#create-referralaccount).
* You need to create a `referralTokenAccount` for each token mint you want to collect fees in.
* We don't recommend creating a token account for **every** token mint, as it costs rent and most tokens might not be valuable, instead created token accounts for top mints to begin with (you can always add more later).

```js expandable theme={null}
import { ReferralProvider } from "@jup-ag/referral-sdk";
import { Connection, Keypair, PublicKey, sendAndConfirmTransaction } from "@solana/web3.js";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
const privateKeyArray = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/Path/to/.config/solana/id.json', 'utf8').trim());
const wallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(privateKeyArray));
const provider = new ReferralProvider(connection);

async function initReferralTokenAccount() {
  const mint = new PublicKey("So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112"); // the token mint you want to collect fees in

  const transaction = await provider.initializeReferralTokenAccountV2({
    payerPubKey: wallet.publicKey,
    referralAccountPubKey: new PublicKey("insert-referral-account-pubkey-here"),
    mint,
  });

    const referralTokenAccount = await connection.getAccountInfo(
      transaction.tokenAccount,
    );

    if (!referralTokenAccount) {
      const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction.tx, [wallet]);
      console.log('signature:', `https://solscan.io/tx/${signature}`);
      console.log('created referralTokenAccountPubKey:', transaction.tokenAccount.toBase58());
      console.log('mint:', mint.toBase58());
    } else {
      console.log(
        `referralTokenAccount ${transaction.tokenAccount.toBase58()} for mint ${mint.toBase58()} already exists`,
      );
    }
}
```

### Usage in Ultra Swap

* After creating the necessary accounts, you can now add the `referralAccount` and `referralFee` to the Ultra Swap `/order` endpoint.
* From the order response, you should see the `feeMint` field, which is the token mint we will collect the fees in for that particular order.
* From the order response, you should see the `feeBps` field, which is the total fee in bps, which should be exactly what you specified in `referralFee`.
* Then, you can sign and send the transaction via the Ultra Swap `/execute` endpoint.

<Warning>
  **DANGER**

  Do note that, during your request to `/order`, we will check if the specific fee mint's referral token account is initialized. If it is not, the order will still return and can be executed without your fees. This is to ensure success rates and the best experience with Jupiter Ultra Swap.

  Hence, please verify the transaction when testing with a new referral token account, and always create the referral token account before calling `/order`.
</Warning>

```js expandable theme={null}
import { Keypair, VersionedTransaction } from "@solana/web3.js";
import fs from 'fs';

const privateKeyArray = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/Path/to/.config/solana/id.json', 'utf8').trim());
const wallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(privateKeyArray));

const orderResponse = await (
  await fetch(

const transaction = VersionedTransaction.deserialize(Buffer.from(transactionBase64, 'base64')); // Deserialize the transaction
transaction.sign([wallet]); // Sign the transaction

    console.error('Swap failed:', JSON.stringify(executeResponse, null, 2));
    console.log(`https://solscan.io/tx/${executeResponse.signature}`);
}
```

## Claim All Fees

* The `claimAllV2` method will return a list of transactions to claim all fees and are batched by 5 claims for each transaction.
* The code signs and sends the transactions one by one - you can also Jito Bundle to send multiple at once, if preferred.
* When claiming fees, the transaction will include the transfer of the fees to both your referral account and Jupiter's (20% of your integrator fees).

```js expandable theme={null}
import { ReferralProvider } from "@jup-ag/referral-sdk";
import { Connection, Keypair, PublicKey, sendAndConfirmRawTransaction } from "@solana/web3.js";

const connection = new Connection("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
const privateKeyArray = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/Path/to/.config/solana/id.json', 'utf8').trim());
const wallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(privateKeyArray));
const provider = new ReferralProvider(connection);

async function claimAllTokens() {
  const transactions = await provider.claimAllV2({
    payerPubKey: wallet.publicKey,
    referralAccountPubKey: new PublicKey("insert-referral-account-pubkey-here"),
  })

  // Send each claim transaction one by one.
  for (const transaction of transactions) {
    transaction.sign([wallet]);

    const signature = await sendAndConfirmRawTransaction(connection, transaction.serialize(), [wallet]);
    console.log('signature:', `https://solscan.io/tx/${signature}`);
  }
}
```


# Execute Order
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/ultra/execute-order

Swap via Ultra by signing then submitting the transaction to the Execute endpoint .

## Sign Transaction

Using the Solana `web3.js@1` library, you can sign the transaction as follows:

<Accordion title="Set up dependencies and wallet for signing">
  **Set up dependencies for signing**

  ```bash  theme={null}
  npm install @solana/web3.js@1
  ```

  **Set up Development Wallet**

  <Info>
    You can paste in your private key for testing but this is not recommended for production.

    * Either use your private key in the project directly, you can do it via a `.env` file.
    * Or set up your private key in the [Solana CLI](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation#create-wallet).

    // In your .env file
    PRIVATE_KEY=""

    // In your index.js (or any file that needs the private key)
    import { Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
    import dotenv from 'dotenv';
    require('dotenv').config();

    const wallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(bs58.decode(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY || '')));
    ```

    ```javascript Store private key in Solana CLI theme={null}

    const privateKeyArray = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/Path/to/.config/solana/id.json', 'utf8').trim());
    const wallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(privateKeyArray));
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

```js Sign Transaction theme={null}
import { VersionedTransaction } from '@solana/web3.js';

// ... Get Order's response

// Extract the transaction from the order response
const transactionBase64 = orderResponse.transaction

// Deserialize, sign and serialize the transaction
const transaction = VersionedTransaction.deserialize(Buffer.from(transactionBase64, 'base64'));
transaction.sign([wallet]);
const signedTransaction = Buffer.from(transaction.serialize()).toString('base64');
```

## Execute Order

By making a post request to the `/execute` endpoint, Jupiter executes the swap transaction on behalf of you/your users through our own proprietary transaction sending infrastructure. This already includes handling of slippage, priority fees, transaction landing and more.

To make a post request to execute a swap order, you need to pass in the required parameters,:

* `signedTransaction`: The signed and serialized base64 encodedtransaction [like above](#sign-transaction)
* `requestId`: The order response's request ID [from Get Order](/docs/ultra/get-order)

```js Execute Order theme={null}
const executeResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://lite-api.jup.ag/ultra/v1/execute', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            signedTransaction: signedTransaction,
            requestId: orderResponse.requestId,
        }),
    })
).json();
```

## Transaction Status Polling

After our transaction sending service has submitted your swap, we will actively poll for your transaction status as part of the `/execute` endpoint. You will receive a response with the status of the swap.

<Tip>
  * You can submit with the same `signedTransaction` and `requestId` for **up to 2 minutes regardless of state**, to poll for the transaction status.
  * The transaction will not double execute since it has the same signature.
  * If connection got dropped, you can try again with the same `signedTransaction` and `requestId` to poll for the status of the swap.
  * If there is no status, the order likely expired (did not get processed onchain and failed), but reach out to us if cases like this happen.
</Tip>

```js Transaction Status Polling theme={null}
if (executeResponse.status === "Success") {
    console.log('Swap successful:', JSON.stringify(executeResponse, null, 2));
    console.log(`https://solscan.io/tx/${executeResponse.signature}`);
} else {
    console.error('Swap failed:', JSON.stringify(executeResponse, null, 2));
    console.log(`https://solscan.io/tx/${executeResponse.signature}`);
}
```


# Get Holdings
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/ultra/get-holdings

Ultra Swap API to get the detailed token holdings of an account.

```js  theme={null}
const holdingsResponse = await (
  await fetch(`https://lite-api.jup.ag/ultra/v1/holdings/3X2LFoTQecbpqCR7G5tL1kczqBKurjKPHhKSZrJ4wgWc`)
).json();

console.log(JSON.stringify(holdingsResponse, null, 2));
```

## Holdings Response

The holdings response will return the following:

* A list of token holdings for the user's wallet address.
* Token account information for each token holding.
* Note that the top level response outside of `tokens` is the native SOL balance.

:::tip
For tokens with more than thousands of token holdings, the response may be slow - depending on the number of token holdings, the response time may vary.

If you only need the native SOL balance, you can use `/holdings/{address}/native` to get the native SOL balance.
:::

**Successful example response:**

```json  theme={null}

# Get Order
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/ultra/get-order

Swap via Ultra by getting a quote from the Order endpoint.

To get an Ultra Swap order, you need to pass in the required parameters such as:

    await fetch(
        'https://lite-api.jup.ag/ultra/v1/order'
        '?inputMint=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112' +

        '&taker=jdocuPgEAjMfihABsPgKEvYtsmMzjUHeq9LX4Hvs7f3'
    )
  ).json();
```

## Order Response

In the order response, you will receive a number of fields that are important to note of, such as the `swapType`, `slippageBps`, etc.

The main fields you should need:

* `transaction`: The base64 encoded transaction that you need to sign before submitting to the network.
* `requestId`: The request ID of the order to be used in the `Execute Order` endpoint.

Now, you are able to get a swap order, next steps is to make a post request to the `Execute Order` endpoint. [Let's go](/docs/ultra/execute-order)!


# Get Shield
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/ultra/get-shield

Ultra Swap API to retrieve token information and associated warnings for the specified mint addresses.

This is useful when integrating with Jupiter Ultra Swap or any other APIs, allowing you or your user to be informed of any potential malicious mints before conducting your transaction.

```js  theme={null}
const shieldResponse = await (
  await fetch(`https://lite-api.jup.ag/ultra/v1/shield?mints=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112,EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v,someTokenAddressForEducationalPurposes`)
).json();
```

## Shield Response

The shield response will return a list of objects, containing the token information and warnings of the mints passed in.

Do note that this is subject to changes, and we will be adding more warnings and improving the accuracy of the warnings over time.

For the full list of potential warnings, refer to the [Shield API Reference](/api-reference/ultra/shield).

**Successful example response:**

```json expandable theme={null}

# Overview
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/ultra/index

Overview of Ultra Swap and its features.

Ultra Swap is the most advanced yet developer-friendly solution for building trading applications on Solana. Ultra Swap is designed to be the only solution you’ll ever need for creating exceptional trading experiences.

## Quick Launch

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Ultra Swap API" icon="code" href="/docs/ultra/get-started">
    RPC-less architecture and Jupiter handles all trading optimizations for you.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Plugin" icon="puzzle-piece" href="/tool-kits/plugin">
    Easiest way to integrate full end-to-end Ultra Swap interface.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Features

<Callout icon="book-open" color="#FFC107" iconType="regular">[Read our latest blog on Ultra V3](/blog/ultra-v3).</Callout>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Juno Liquidity Engine">
    Ultra Swap utilizes the latest [Juno Liquidity Engine](/docs/routing) which aggregates across multiple liquidity sources, including Jupiter's proprietary routing engines: improved versions of Metis and JupiterZ, and third-party liquidity sources, for the best possible price.

    It also includes self-learning capabilities (to detect and sideline low-quality liquidity sources) which creates a competitive environment for all liquidity sources to continously optimize their performance and price.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Execution-Optimized Predictive Routing">
    Ultra runs Predictive Routing for every route before execution:

    1. Aggregated routers return their best quotes.
    2. Ultra performs on-chain simulation of each route.
    3. Simulating quotes on-chain to verify actual executable price vs quoted price.
    4. Predicting potential slippage for each route, and dynamically prioritizing the route with the least overall incurred slippage at the time of execution.

    Results:

    * Quotes reflect actual on-chain execution, not theoretical best-case scenarios.
    * With this feature, we have increased our swap success rate from 85% to \~96%.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sub-second Transaction Landing & MEV Protection">
    Ultra is now using our new in-house transaction-landing engine, ShadowLane, which allows us to send transactions via our own infrastructure: designed to make every trade faster, more private, and more precise.

    * Leverage our own validator stake and dedicated R\&D efforts.
    * Complete transaction privacy until on-chain execution.
    * Eliminate the risk of artificial delays and front-running, ensuring faster and more secure execution for our users.

    Results:

    * Landing Latency: Improved by 50-66% compared to our previous approach that relied on multiple providers
      * Lands in 0–1 block (\~50–400ms)
      * Compared to the 1–3 blocks (\~400ms–1.2s) previously.
    * MEV Protection: Routing transactions through our own infrastructure provides:
      * Complete transaction privacy until on-chain execution.
      * Reduce frontrunning exposure - transactions are invisible to public mempool scanners.
      * Reduce risk of sandwich attack vectors - [see our blog post on Ultra's swap volume to value extracted ratio](/blog/ultra-v3#mev-protection).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Real Time Slippage Estimator">
    Building on top of our previous versions of slippage estimation/optimization engines, we have developed a new Real Time Slippage Estimator (RTSE), that is able to intelligently estimate the best possible slippage to use at the time of execution, balancing between trade success and price protection.

    RTSE uses a variety of heuristics, algorithms and monitoring to ensure the best user experience:

    * Heuristics: Token categories, historical and real-time slippage data, and more.
      * Uses token categories to intelligently estimate slippage for different token types.
      * Automatic prioritization of slippage-protected routes over purely price-optimized routes.
      * Increased volatility sensitivity for tokens with high historical volatility patterns.
    * Algorithms: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on slippage data, and more.
    * Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of failure rates to ensure reactiveness to increase slippage when necessary.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gasless">
    Ultra Swap provides different gasless mechanisms for different scenarios.

    * Gasless via Jupiter Z (RFQ): All swaps routed via Jupiter Z are gasless, as the market maker is the fee payer for the transaction.
    * Gasless via Gasless Support: Depending on the tokens and trade sizes of your swap, Ultra Swap will automatically determine if it can provide gasless support to your swap by helping you pay for the transaction fee of your swap - you can identify this via the secondary signer in the transaction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API Latency">
    95% of all swaps are executed under 2 seconds via our proprietary transaction sending engine.

## What About Legacy Swap API?

Ultra Swap API is the next evolution of our swap infrastructure, designed and continuously optimized to deliver the best possible trading experience on Solana. We are focused on providing a high-performance, reliable, and feature-rich API that incorporates the latest advancements and optimizations for users and integrators.

While Ultra Swap API is engineered for optimal performance and ease of integration, the Legacy Swap API remains available for developers who require advanced customization, such as:

* Adding custom instructions.
* Incorporating Cross Program Invocation (CPI) calls.
* Selecting specific broadcasting strategies for signed transactions (e.g., priority fee, Jito, etc.).
* Choosing which DEXes or AMMs to route through.
* Modifying the number of accounts used in a transaction.

If your use case demands these highly custom features, the Legacy Swap API may be more suitable. However, it also requires you to manage many aspects that Ultra Swap API handles automatically, including:

* **RPC management**: Retrieving wallet balances, broadcasting, and tracking transactions.
* **Transaction fee selection**: Managing priority fees, Jito fees, and more.
* **Slippage optimization**: Determining the best slippage settings for trade success and price protection.
* **Transaction broadcasting**: Ultra Swap leverages a proprietary transaction engine for superior speed and reliability.
* **Swap result parsing**: Handling transaction polling, parsing, and error management.

For most developers and applications, Ultra Swap API is the recommended choice, as it is purpose-built and continually improved to provide the best possible swap experience on Solana.

# Rate Limit
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/ultra/rate-limit

The Ultra Swap API uses a unique rate limiting mechanism that scales with your executed swap volume over time.

## Overview

| Property                | Dynamic                                      |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Base URL**            | `https://api.jup.ag/ultra/`                  |
| **Cost**                | Free to use, but Ultra Swap incurs swap fees |
| **API Key**             | Required                                     |
| **Requests Per Minute** | Base Quota + Added Quota                     |

## API Key Rules

The Ultra Swap API requires an API key to be used and can be generated via [Portal](https://portal.jup.ag).

* It is required to be used for the Dynamic Rate Limit.
* The API Key is free to generate and is universal, the API Key will work for all APIs.
* Upgrading to a Pro plan only applies to other APIs, does not work with Ultra Swap API.

<Card title="Read about Portal Rate Limits for full details" href="/portal/rate-limit" icon="book-open" horizontal />

## How Dynamic Rate Limit Works

Every **10 minutes**

* The system aggregates your swap volume from `/execute` on Ultra Swap for **the current rolling day** (volume of (current timestamp - 1 day) up to present).
* After which, the Added Quota will update, which will be added on top of the Base Quota.

| Swap Volume | Requests Per Period       | Sliding Window Period |
| :---------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------- |
| \$0         | 50 Base + 0 Added = 50    | 10 seconds            |
| \$10,000    | 50 Base + 1 Added = 51    | 10 seconds            |
| \$100,000   | 50 Base + 11 Added = 61   | 10 seconds            |
| \$1,000,000 | 50 Base + 115 Added = 165 | 10 seconds            |

<Warning>
  The formula is subject to changes as we experiment with the Dynamic Rate Limit system.

  If you find that the rate limit is too restrictive, please reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/jup).

1. Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic
2. Wait for sliding window to allow for more requests
3. **Scale your Ultra Swap usage** to unlock higher limits or reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/jup).

<Warning>
  Bursting beyond your allocation may result in **temporary 429s/rate limits**, even after the refill period. Avoid aggressive retry patterns.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

It is important to understand the error codes to provide a better experience for your users, helping them make an informed decision or follow up step to help their transaction succeed.

<Info>
  See [https://jup.ag/](https://jup.ag/) as a reference to understand how we handle errors on the UI.

# Search Token
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/docs/ultra/search-token



The Ultra Swap API provides an endpoint to search tokens in the background for you and returns you the search results, along with the mint information.

This is useful in most user applications, as users need to choose which tokens they want to swap. This also provides a seamless developer experience as integrating this allows us to handle and abstract the token search mechanism, allowing you to focus on other user features.

<Info>
  **SEARCH**

  * Search for a token and its information by its **symbol, name or mint address**.
  * Comma-separate to search for multiple.
  * Limit to 100 mint addresses in query.
  * Default to 20 mints in response when searching via symbol or name.
</Info>

```js  theme={null}
const searchResponse = await (
  await fetch(`https://lite-api.jup.ag/ultra/v1/search?query=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112`)
).json();
```

## Search Response

The search response will return an array of mints, along with their information.

<Tip>
  **USEFUL MINT INFORMATION**

  * Token Metadata like name, symbol, icon to display token information to users
  * [Organic Score](/docs/tokens/organic-score), Holder count, Market cap, etc can be useful to help make a better trading decision
  * And much more!

  Do note that the response is subject to changes as we continue to improve.

  Refer to [Ultra Swap API Reference](/api-reference/ultra/search) for full schema.

# Development Basics
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/get-started/development-basics

Learn the basics of Solana and Jupiter development, including interacting with Solana programs and accounts, building transactions, and sending transactions to the network.

Solana uses an account-based architecture where data are stored in accounts. However, Solana keeps Programs (also known as smart contracts on other blockchains) and Accounts distinct.

<Tip>
  **Where are the Jupiter Programs deployed?**

  Jupiter is built on Solana MAINNET only!
</Tip>

In order to mutate the data in Accounts, you will need to send transactions to the network which execute Instructions defined by Programs.

* [Programs](https://solana.com/docs/core/programs) on Solana are executable code deployed on-chain. They are designed to execute instructions, process transactions and interact with accounts.
* [Instructions](https://solana.com/docs/core/transactions#instruction) on Solana are defined by the Program, similar to API endpoints exposed by a program.
* [Accounts](https://solana.com/docs/core/accounts) store data and are mutable, meaning they can be updated by the program who interacts with them.
* [Transactions](https://solana.com/docs/core/transactions#transaction) is what we send to interact with the network which can include one or more instructions to execute what is needed.

## Interacting with Solana

The Solana Web3.js and Rust client libraries serve as essential interfaces for interacting with Solana in JavaScript/TypeScript and Rust environments, respectively. They abstract complex interactions with the network, providing easier and more accessible functions for developers building on Solana. Here’s an overview of what each library offers and some of the most common functions they simplify:

1. Connecting to the network via RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoints
2. Building Transactions
3. Interfacing with Solana Programs and Accounts

<Info>
  Explore the rich features and detailed documentation of these libraries in the official Solana Developer Documentation: [Web3.js](https://solana.com/docs/clients/javascript) and [Rust client](https://solana.com/docs/clients/rust)
</Info>

## Interacting with Jupiter

For example, to use the Jupiter Swap Aggregator Program, there are a few ways to do it:

| Method                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Ultra Swap API](/docs/ultra)                                      | Simply call the order endpoint to get a quote, sign then submit the transaction to the execute endpoint, we handle the rest for you, no RPCs needed!                                                                                                   |
| Flash Fill method                                                  | If you are building your own on-chain program, an alternative method from CPI, using Versioned Transaction and Address Lookup Tables, thus reducing the size of each account (used to be a limitation of using CPI method).                            |
| [Cross Program Invocation (CPI)](https://solana.com/docs/core/cpi) | CPI method is now recommended. As of January 2025, Jupiter Swap via CPI is recommended for most users. [The `Loosen CPI restriction` feature has been deployed on Solana, you can read more here](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/26641). |

## Building Transactions

Before you send a transaction to the network, you will need to build the transaction that defines the instructions to execute and accounts to read/write to. It can be complex to handle this yourself when building with Jupiter, you can [read more about it here](https://solana.com/docs/core/transactions).

<Tip>
  However, good news! The [Ultra Swap API](/docs/ultra) handles everything for you!

  1. You get an order response with the encoded transaction.
  2. You sign the transaction and submit to execute.
  3. We handle the transaction sending and the rest for you.
</Tip>

## Sending Transactions

Transactions on Solana can only be sent to the network through an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoint. The Solana network operates with a client-server model where RPC nodes handle transactions and interact with the validators of the blockchain. We recommend using 3rd party RPC providers like [Triton](https://triton.one/) or [Helius](https://helius.dev/) for production applications.

There are a few key points to note when sending transactions to the Solana network.

1. Solana transaction base fee
2. Priority fee
3. Compute units
4. Transaction broadcasting methods
5. Slippage (100% slippage will probably always work but also mean you can possibly get the worst outcome, so we need to find the balance between success optimizations and best output price)

<Tip>
  By using [Ultra Swap API](/docs/ultra), we will optimize all of these for you!

  * No additional params from you.
  * No RPCs required from you.
  * Simply let us handle and optimize it for you.
</Tip>

## About these factors

### What is Priority Fee

Transactions submitted to the blockchain are prioritized based on a fee-bidding process. The higher the priority fee, the higher your transaction will be placed in the execution queue.

<Note>
  **Overpaying Priority Fee**

  It is important to note that overpaying for priority fee can be detrimental in the long run. If transactions continuously outbid each other, the overall fees required to process across the network will increase over time.
</Note>

**Priority Fee** is an optional fee you can pay additionally to improve the chance of landing your transactions faster.

* Priority Fee = **Compute Budget \* Compute Unit Price**
* This is excluding the base transaction fee (5,000 lamports or 0.000005 SOL) that you always need to pay.
* You not only need to outbid other transactions trying to be included in the block, but also outbid those trying to write to the same account.

| Terminologies       |                                                                                 |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Global Priority Fee | The Priority Fee estimation across the entire network.                          |
| Local Fee Market    | The Priority Fee estimation when modifying a writable account (or hot account). |
| Priority Fee        | Compute Budget \* Compute Unit Price                                            |
| Compute Budget      | How much compute unit the transaction is supposed to consume                    |
| Compute Unit Price  | Micro lamports per compute unit the transaction will use                        |

When querying the micro-lamport per compute unit for a particular program or account, it will contain both the Global and Local Fee markets.

### What is Compute Unit

Compute Unit (CU) is a standardized metric for evaluating how much "work" or "resource" is required by the transaction to execute. Different operations on Solana has varying amounts of CUs. In order to keep the blockchain efficient yet fast, each transaction, the Solana runtime has an absolute max compute unit limit of 1.4 million CU and sets a default requested max limit of 200k CU per instruction.

<Tip>
  **Set Custom Compute Unit Limit**

  A transaction can request a more specific and optimal compute unit limit by including a single `SetComputeUnitLimit` instruction. Either a higher or lower limit. But it may never request higher than the absolute max limit per transaction.
</Tip>

However, we must note that higher CU also means higher Priority Fee it might need to help prioritize it.

### What are some transaction broadcasting methods

1. Typical RPCs
2. RPCs with SWQoS
3. Jito RPC

### What is Slippage

A percentage or bps threshold the user specify and if the actual executed output is less than quoted output by the percentage/bps, the transaction will fail.

It is more like a safeguard but the tighter threshold you go, the harder it can become to land the transaction as markets can move rapidly.


# Environment Setup
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/get-started/environment-setup

Get Started with setting up libraries, connection and local wallet to build with Jupiter API.

<Info>
  **ABOUT THE DOCUMENTATION**

  In the documentation, we are using the Solana `web3.js` library to set up connection, sign transactions, etc.
</Info>

## Useful Libraries

**JavaScript Libraries**

* `@solana/web3.js`
* `@solana/spl-token`

## Useful Scripts

**Set up RPC Connection**

<Info>
  Solana provides a [default RPC endpoint](https://solana.com/docs/core/clusters). However, as your application grows, we recommend you to always use your own or provision a 3rd party provider’s RPC endpoint such as [Helius](https://helius.dev/) or [Triton](https://triton.one/).
</Info>

```bash  theme={null}
const connection = new Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');
```

**Set up Development Wallet**

<Info>
  You can paste in your private key for testing but this is not recommended for production.

  * Either use your private key in the project directly, you can do it via a `.env` file.
  * Or set up your private key in the [Solana CLI](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation#create-wallet).
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Store private key in .env theme={null}
  // In your .env file
  PRIVATE_KEY=""

  // In your index.js (or any file that needs the private key)
  import { Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
  import dotenv from 'dotenv';
  require('dotenv').config();

  const wallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(bs58.decode(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY || '')));
  ```

  ```javascript Store private key in Solana CLI theme={null}
  import { Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
  import fs from 'fs';

  const privateKeyArray = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/Path/to/.config/solana/id.json', 'utf8').trim());
  const wallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(privateKeyArray));
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This information concerns, among other things, the data categories we process, for what purposes we process them, the origin of the data if we did not acquire them directly from you and, if applicable, the recipients to who we have sent your data.
* right of access – You may ask us whether we process your Personal Data and you have the right to request a copy of the data we hold about you.
* right of rectification – You have the right to correct inaccurate or incomplete data about you.
* right to be forgotten – You can ask for the Personal Data that we hold about you to be erased from our system and we will comply with this request unless we have a legitimate reason, legal requirement, and other statutory basis not to do so. Even if we can delete (erase) the Personal Data subject to our active (ongoing) processing activities and cease its processing, we will nevertheless retain this particular Personal Data in our backup and archive storages to fulfill our statutory and other requirements.
* right to restriction of processing – where certain conditions apply, you can ask us to ‘block’ the processing of your Personal Data.
* right to data portability – You have the right to have the data we hold about you transferred to another organization and to receive Personal Data in a structured, commonly used format. Please apply to: `[privacy@jup.ag]` to find out whether we currently support the provision of the portable file containing Personal Data we process about you.
* right to object - You can object to the processing of your data by applying to: `[privacy@jup.ag]` at any time for reasons that arise from your special situation provided the data processing is based on our legitimate interest or that of a third party, or where we carry out profiling, use machine learning or automated decision-making algorithms. In this case, we will no longer process your Personal Data. The latter does not apply if we are able to prove there are compelling, defensible reasons for the processing that outweigh your interests or we require your data to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims.
* right to withdraw consent - withdraw the consent you gave us with regard to the processing of your Personal Data for certain purposes.
* right to complain - we take your rights very seriously. However, if you are of the opinion that we have not dealt with your complaints adequately, you have the right to submit a complaint to the data privacy protection authorities responsible. You can send your complaints to the EEA supervisory authority of your country of residence.

Please email: `[privacy@jup.ag]` with any questions about exercising any of the above rights. If You wish to learn more about the GDPR and Your rights, the Information Commissioner’s Office website is a reliable source.

### 7. Privacy of children

Our Interface is not directed to collect any data from people under the age of 18. We do not knowingly allow anyone under 18 years old to submit any data to our Interface. If you believe your child may have provided us with their data, you can contact us using the information in this Policy and we will delete the data from our Interface.

### 8. Transfer of Personal Data

Transfers to third countries shall be made subject to appropriate safeguards, namely Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the supervisory authority and approved by the Commission. Copy of the foregoing appropriate safeguards may be obtained by you upon a prior written request sent. We may instruct you on further steps to be taken with the purpose of obtaining such a copy, including your obligation to assume confidentiality commitments in connection with being disclosed the Jupiter proprietary and personal information of third parties as well as terms of their relationships with Jupiter.

Keep in mind that the use of the Interface based on public blockchains is intended to immutably record transactions across wide networks of computer systems. Many blockchains are open to forensic analysis which can lead to deanonymization and the unintentional revelation of Personal Data, in particular when blockchain data is combined with other data. Because blockchains are decentralized or third-party networks that are not controlled or operated by us, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter Personal Data from such networks.

### 9. Data Integrity & Security of Processing

We take data security very seriously. We work hard to protect the Personal Data you provide us from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access. We utilize a variety of safeguards such as encryption, digital and physical access controls, non-disclosure agreements, and other technical and organizational measures to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is at rest.

Please note that no electronic transmission, storage, or processing of Personal Data can be entirely secure. We cannot guarantee that the security measures we have in place to safeguard Personal Data will never be defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective. Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect that your Personal Data will always remain private or secure.

### 10. Supervisory authority oversight

If you are a data subject whose data we process, you may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection regulator in one or more of the European Union member states. Here you can find a list of data protection authorities in Europe: ​​[https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en)

Jupiter API & SDK License Agreement

<Card title="SDK & API License Agreement File" href="https://github.com/jup-ag/docs/tree/main/static/files/legal" icon="link" iconType="solid" horizontal />

**IMPORTANT**: This Jupiter API & SDK License Agreement ("Agreement") govern your access and use of the Jupiter Application Programming Interface ("API") and a Software Development Kit ("SDK") available through [https://portal.jup.ag](https://portal.jup.ag) (collectively the "Service"). If you do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not use the Service.

This Agreement is effective as of the date you first access, download, copy or otherwise use the API or SDK ("Effective Date"), and constitutes the entire agreement between you and us. This Agreement shall continue until terminated either by us or by you. Even after termination of this Agreement, certain provisions will survive, as discussed herein.

This Agreement also incorporates Jupiter's [Terms of Service](/legal/terms-of-use) and [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy) which terms shall also govern your use of the Service. Our Privacy Policy, in particular explains how, to the extent that we do, your data may be collected. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.

YOU ARE ENTERING A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT: BY COPYING, DOWNLOADING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE JUPITER API OR SDK YOU ARE EXPRESSLY AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY ALL TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO COPY, DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR OTHERWISE USE THE JUPITER API or SDK.

The API and SDK are protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The API and SDK is licensed to you, and its use is subject to the terms of this Agreement.

**1. Definitions​**

1.1 **"Application Programming Interfaces"** or **"API"** or **"Jupiter API"** means the back-end smart routing algorithm which facilitates the user's efficient swapping of digital assets at a variety of third party trading venues, which may include object code, software libraries, software tools, sample source code, published specifications and Documentation. Jupiter API shall include any future, updated or otherwise modified version(s) thereof furnished by Jupiter (in its sole discretion) to Licensee.

1.2 **"Software Development Kit"** or **"SDK"** or **"Jupiter SDK"** means the ancillary tools and resources that allow the user to utilise or integrate the API. Jupiter SDK shall include any future, updated or otherwise modified version(s) thereof furnished by Jupiter (in its sole discretion) to Licensee.

1.3 **"Documentation"** includes, but is not limited to programmer guides, manuals, materials, and information appropriate or necessary for use in connection with the API, and in particular shall include the Integrator Guidelines available at [https://dev.jup.ag/legal](https://dev.jup.ag/legal).

**2. Grant of License​**

2.1 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Jupiter hereby grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, fee-bearing, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licence to use the API or SDK during the term of this Agreement solely for the purpose of Licensee's internal development efforts to develop products or services integrating the API and/or SDK in any manner, including without limitation for any informational, comparison, or testing purpose (the **Licensee's Product**).

2.2 Licensee shall have no right to distribute, license (whether or not through multiple tiers) or otherwise transfer the API or SDK to any third party.

2.3 There are several formulations and versions of the API routing engine, which comprise either (a) the Jupiter Ultra Swap API, and (b) the Jupiter Legacy Swap API. Notwithstanding any of the provisions herein, where the Licensee uses the API or SDK (including without limitation for any informational, comparison, or testing purpose), you unconditionally and irrevocably undertake to correctly and accurately display prominently/label/name/characterise the specific API used, which must be made visible to end users of the Licensee’s Product. For illustrative purposes, if the Licensee uses Jupiter Ultra Swap, it would be mandatory to prominently state “Jupiter Ultra”; if the Licensee uses anything available API other than Jupiter Ultra Swap, it would be mandatory to prominently state “Jupiter Legacy”. The Licensee accepts that it is misleading and unethical to wrongly display/label/name/characterise the API and any output of the API as “Jupiter” simpliciter or otherwise suggest it is the same product as the service available at [https://jup.ag/](https://jup.ag/), or represent that another API routing engine is utilised. Without prejudice to clause 11 below, in the event of your breach of this clause 2.3, you agree to indemnify us to the extent any loss or damages are suffered by, as a result of, or in connection with, your breach of this clause 2.3, including but not limited to pure and/or consequential economic loss.

2.4 In case of potential other API or SDK use that is not prescribed by this Agreement, please write to [info@jup.ag](mailto:info@jup.ag) to seek written consent.

2.5 Representations. Both Parties to this Agreement are duly organized and validly existing in good standing with all requisite power and authority to enter into this Agreement and conduct its business as is now being conducted. The Licensee is not identified on, or engages in any transactions with any party listed on, any sanctions list maintained by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”).

2.6 By providing access to the API and the SDK, Jupiter is solely providing a back-end technical service to the Licensee which allows the Licensee to provide swap-related services to end users of the Licensee's products or services. Jupiter is not a party to any agreement for swap-related services between the Licensee, its end users, any counterparty or trading venue where swaps are performed, nor any trustee, custodian, bailee, manager, administrator or service provider in respect of any digital asset or otherwise.

2.7 Independent Contractor Relationship. The relationship between the Parties is that of independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create anything like the relationship of an employer and employee, joint venture, partnership, or joint association.

**3. Other Rights and Limitations​**

3.1 Copies. Licensee may copy the API or SDK only as necessary for the purpose of the licence hereunder.

3.2 Except as expressly authorised under this Agreement or by Jupiter in writing, the Licensee agrees it shall not (and shall not permit or authorise any other person to):

Jupiter shall be granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licence to use the Licensee's Product (including without limitation any application programming interface, software development kit, logos, brand information, technical information or data or information in connection with any aspect of the Licensee's Product) for any purpose.

3.4 Third Party Software. Licensee acknowledges that effective utilization of the API and SDK may require the use of a development tool, compiler and other software and technology of third parties ("Third Party Software"). Licensee is solely responsible for procuring such Third-Party Software and technology and the necessary licenses for the use thereof. Jupiter makes no representation or warranty concerning Third Party Software and shall have no obligation or liability with respect to Third Party Software.

3.5 No right is granted to Licensee to sublicense its rights hereunder. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Jupiter and, except as expressly set forth herein, no license is granted by Jupiter under this Agreement directly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, under any patent, copyright, trade secret or trademark or other intellectual property rights of Jupiter. Nothing herein shall be deemed to authorize Licensee to use Jupiter\`s trademarks or trade names in Licensee's advertising, marketing, promotional, sales or related materials. Jupiter reserves all rights not otherwise expressly granted in this Agreement.

Licensee agrees not to assert any patent rights related to the API/SDK or applications developed using the API/SDK against Jupiter, Jupiter's participants, or other licensees of the API/SDK for making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing any products or technology developed using the API/SDK.

3.7 Jupiter may from time to time provide updates or upgrades to the API or SDK. Any such updates and upgrades will be performed according to Jupiter's then-current operational policies, which may include automatic updating or upgrading of API or SDK currently in use at that time. Where the Licensee fails to accept such updates or upgrades, Jupiter shall be entitled to withhold access to the API, SDK and/or Service, and the same shall not constitute any breach of the terms of this Agreement.

**4. Intellectual Property and proprietary rights**

4.1 As between Jupiter and Licensee, Jupiter and/or its licensors shall own and retain all proprietary rights, including all patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other intellectual property rights, in and to the API and SDK and any corrections, bug fixes, enhancements, updates, improvements, or modifications thereto and (to the extent such rights accrue to the Licensee), the Licensee hereby irrevocably transfers, conveys and assigns to Jupiter all of its right, title, and interest therein.

4.2 Jupiter shall have the exclusive right to apply for or register any patents, mask work rights, copyrights, and such other proprietary protections with respect thereto.

4.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the license granted under this Agreement does not provide Licensee with title or ownership to the API or SDK, but only a right of limited use under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

4.4 The Parties acknowledge that Jupiter does not store, send, or receive digital assets. Digital assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the relevant blockchain network. Any creation or transfer of title that might occur in respect of any digital asset occurs on the relevant blockchain network (on the relevant contractual terms applicable to such creation and/or transfer) and is performed by the Licensee's Product, and Jupiter does not have any role or responsibility in such transactions. Jupiter cannot guarantee that the Licensee's Product, or any party can effect the transfer of such title or right to any digital asset. Accordingly, Jupiter cannot provide any guarantee, warranty or assurance regarding the authenticity, uniqueness, originality, quality, marketability, legality or value of any digital assets utilised in connection with the API and the Services.

**5. No Obligation to Support​**

5.1 Subject to payment of fees as described herein, Jupiter would issue to the Licensee certain unique API keys, tokens, passwords and/or other credentials (collectively, **"Keys"**), for accessing the API and/or SDK and managing the Licensee's access to the API. The Licensee may only access the API with the Keys issued to the Licensee by Jupiter. The Licensee acknowledges that access to the API may not always be available. The Licensee may not sell, transfer, sublicense or otherwise disclose its Keys to any other party or use them for any other purpose other than that expressly permitted by Jupiter. The Licensee is responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of the Keys. The Licensee is fully responsible for all activities that occur using the Keys, regardless of whether such activities are undertaken by the Licensee or a third party. The Licensee is responsible for maintaining up-to-date and accurate information (including a current email address and other required contact information) for the Licensee's access to the API and SDK. Jupiter may discontinue the Licensee's access to the API and SDK if such contact information is not up-to-date and/or the Licensee does not respond to communications directed to such coordinates.

5.2 Jupiter makes no guarantees with respect to the performance, availability or uptime of the API or the SDK. Jupiter may conduct maintenance on or stop providing any of the API or the SDK at any time with or without written notice to the Licensee. In addition, Jupiter may change the method of access to the API, SDK and Documentation at any time.

5.3 Jupiter does not guarantee any support for the API or SDK under this Agreement.

14.1 Licensee and Jupiter agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from this Agreement, except for disputes in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS LICENSEE FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.

14.2 Licensee and Jupiter agree to notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to Jupiter shall be sent to [legal@jup.ag](mailto:legal@jup.ag).

By using or accessing the Interface, you represent and warrant that you understand that there are inherent risks associated with virtual currency, and the underlying technologies including, without limitation, cryptography and blockchain, and you agree that Jupiter is not responsible for any losses or damages associated with these risks. You specifically acknowledge and agree that the Interface facilitates your interaction with decentralized networks and technology and, as such, we have no control over any blockchain or virtual currencies and cannot and do not ensure that any of your interactions will be confirmed on the relevant blockchain and do not have the ability to effectuate any cancellation or modification requests regarding any of your interactions.

Without limiting the foregoing, you specifically understand and hereby represent your acknowledgment of the following:

* The pricing information data provided through the Interface does not represent an offer, a solicitation of an offer, or any advice regarding, or recommendation to enter into, a transaction with the Interface.
* The Interface does not act as an agent for any of the users.
* The Interface does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed, and therefore is not responsible for them and their operation.

* Although it is intended to provide accurate and timely information on the Interface, the Interface or relevant tools may not always be entirely accurate, complete, or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the Interface or relevant tools are your sole responsibility.

In order to allow other users to have a full and positive experience of using the Interface you agree that you will not use the Interface in a manner that:

* Breaches the Terms;
* Infringes on or violates any copyright, trademark, service mark, patent, right of publicity, right of privacy, or other proprietary or intellectual property rights under the law;
* Seeks to interfere with or compromise the integrity, security, or proper functioning of any computer, server, network, personal device, or other information technology system, including, but not limited to, the deployment of viruses and denial of service attacks;

You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set forth expressly in the Terms.

You understand that smart contract protocols such as the Protocol simply comprise a set of autonomous blockchain-based smart contracts deployed on the relevant blockchain network, operated directly by users calling functions on it (which allows them to interact with other users in a multi-party peer-to-peer manner). There is no further control by or interaction with the original entity which had deployed the smart contract, which entity solely functions as a provider of technical tools for users, and is not offering any sort of securities product or regulated service nor does it hold any user assets on custody. Any rewards earned by user interactions arise solely out of their involvement in the protocol by taking on the risk of interacting with other users and the ecosystem.

### 5. Non-custodial nature of Interface and Protocol

The Interface and Protocol are non-custodial in nature, therefore neither holds or controls your digital assets. Any digital assets which you may acquire through the usage of the Interface or the Protocol will be held and administered solely by you through your selected electronic wallet, and we shall have no access to or responsibility in regard to such electronic wallet or digital asset held therein. It is solely your responsibility to select the wallet service provider to use, and your use of such electronic wallet will be subject to the governing terms of use or privacy policy of the provider of such wallet. We neither own nor control your selected electronic wallet service, the relevant blockchain network, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to utilise the Interface or the Protocol. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.

We will not create any hosted wallet for you or otherwise custody digital assets on your behalf, and it is your sole responsibility to maintain the security of your selected electronic wallet. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against us, our affiliates and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives related to your use of any wallet software, associated loss of digital assets, transaction failures, or any other defects that arise in the course of your use of your electronic wallet, including any losses that may obtain as a result of any failure of the Interface or the Protocol.

Neither the Company, the Interface nor the Protocol provides any digital asset exchange or portfolio/fund management services. If you choose to engage in transactions with other users via the Interface or the Protocol, then such decisions and transactions and any consequences flowing therefrom are your sole responsibility. In no event shall the Company, its affiliates or their respective directors or employees be responsible or liable to you or anyone else, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss arising from or relating to any interaction or continued interaction with the Interface or the Protocol or in reliance on any information provided on the Interface (including, without limitation, directly or indirectly resulting from errors in, omissions of or alterations to any such information).

"Know Your Customer" and "Anti-Money Laundering" checks We reserve the right to conduct "Know Your Customer" and "Anti-Money Laundering" checks on you if deemed necessary by us (at our sole discretion) or such checks become required under applicable laws in any jurisdiction.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly, some of the disclaimers and limitations set forth in the Terms may not apply to you. This limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.

### 10. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver​

*Binding Arbitration*. Except for disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and the Jupiter: (a) waive the right to have any and all disputes or claims arising from these Terms, your use or access to the Interface or any other disputes with the Jupiter *(collectively, "Disputes")* resolved in a court; and (b) waive any right to a jury trial. Instead, you and the Jupiter agree to arbitrate Disputes that are not resolved informally (as described below) through binding arbitration (i.e. the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it) instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

*No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions*. You and Jupiter agree that any dispute is personal to you and Jupiter and that any such dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding. Neither party agrees to class arbitration or to an arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and the Jupiter agree that a dispute cannot be brought as a class, or other types of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

*Process*. You and the Jupiter agree that each will notify the other, in writing, of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises so that the parties can attempt, in good faith, to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Jupiter shall be provided by sending an email to [legal@jup.ag](mailto:legal@jup.ag). Your notice must include (1) your name, postal address, and email address; (2) a description of the nature or basis of the Dispute; and (3) the specific action that you are seeking. If you and the Jupiter cannot resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days of the Jupiter receiving the notice, either you or Jupiter may, as appropriate pursuant to this Section 12, commence an arbitration proceeding. You and Jupiter agree that any arbitration or claim must be commenced or filed within one (1) year after the Dispute arose; otherwise, you and the Jupiter agree that the claim is permanently barred (which means that you will no longer have the right to assert a claim regarding the Dispute).

*Choice of Law*. These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of Panama, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, govern the Terms and any Dispute between you and us. Any Dispute under these Terms shall be finally settled by Binding Arbitration (as defined below). Any unresolved Dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA), which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Section 12 to the extent they are consistent with it. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in London, United Kingdom, in English, in accordance with the LCIA Arbitration Rules. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate your claims with those of any other party. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, to the extent a court therein would be deemed to be a court of competent jurisdiction other than any court located in the United States of America. You further agree that the Interface shall be deemed to be based solely in Panama and that, although the Interface may be available in other jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside Panama.

*Authority of Arbitrator*. As limited by these Terms and applicable arbitration rules, the arbitrator will have: (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute; and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

### 11. Miscellaneous

*Changes*. We may amend any portion of these Terms at any time by posting the revised version of these Terms with an updated revision date. The changes will become effective and shall be deemed accepted by you, the first time you use or access the Interface after the initial posting of the revised Terms and shall apply on a going-forward basis with respect to your use of the Interface including any transactions initiated after the posting date. In the event that you do not agree with any such modification, your sole and exclusive remedy are to terminate your use of the Interface.

*Entire Agreement*. These Terms (and any additional terms, rules, and conditions of participation that may be posted on the website of Jupiter) including the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement with respect to the Interface and supersedes any prior agreements, oral or written.

*Privacy Policy*. The Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, use, store and disclose your personal information. You agree to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of your data in accordance with the Privacy Policy.

*Severability*. If any provision of these Terms shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any local, state, or federal government agency, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of the provision to the greatest extent possible under any applicable law and the validity or enforceability of any other provision of these Terms shall not be affected. If such construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from these Terms but the rest of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

*Survival*. Upon termination of these Terms for any reason, all rights and obligations of the parties that by their nature are continuing will survive such termination.

*English language*. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, any translation of these Terms is provided for your convenience. The meanings of terms, conditions, and representations herein are subject to their definitions and interpretations in the English language. In the event of conflict or ambiguity between the English language version and translated versions of these terms, the English language version shall prevail. You acknowledge that you have read and understood the English language version of these Terms.

    * The amount payable is pro-rated.
    * Upgrade happens immediately (2 - 5 minutes) is still required to be reflected.
    * Downgrade will happen at the end of the billing period if you are to renew the plan.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use both Pro and Ultra APIs together?">
    * Yes. You can maintain a Pro subscription for all other API routes while integrating Ultra endpoints separately.
    * Do note that purchasing a Pro plan, does not apply its rate limits to Ultra Swap API.

Latency details of Jupiter APIs

In this section, you can find the latency details of Jupiter API.

## Overview

Jupiter API operates through a distributed API gateway infrastructure to provide optimal performance across different geographic regions. The APIs are exclusively HTTP-based, with self-hosted API binary protocols no longer supported.

**Key Factors Affecting Latency:**

* **Geographic Location**: Latency varies significantly based on your server's proximity to Jupiter's API gateways
* **Network Conditions**: Internet routing and congestion can impact response times
* **Request Complexity**: Different endpoints have different processing requirements

## API Gateway Latency

There are no significant differences or no penalty/benefits between the different Portal plans.

<Info>
  Lite APIs typically provides slightly better latency than Pro APIs since it doesn't require additional rate limiter infrastructure processing.
</Info>

## Regional Distribution

Jupiter's API gateway is distributed across multiple AWS regions.

### Supported AWS Regions

| AWS Region Code  | Location    | Recommended For          |
| :--------------- | :---------- | :----------------------- |
| `us-east-1`      | N. Virginia | North America East Coast |
| `us-east-2`      | Ohio        | North America Central    |
| `eu-central-1`   | Frankfurt   | Central Europe           |
| `eu-west-1`      | Ireland     | Western Europe           |
| `ap-southeast-1` | Singapore   | Southeast Asia           |
| `ap-northeast-1` | Tokyo       | Northeast Asia           |

## Latency Optimization Tips

### Server Collocation

**Recommended**: Deploy your servers in the same AWS regions as Jupiter's API gateways for optimal performance.

### Request Simplification

* Simplify your API requests to reduce processing time
* Avoid unnecessary parameters or complex queries
* Use the most direct endpoint for your use case

## Troubleshooting High Latency

If you're experiencing higher than expected latency:

1. **Check your server location** - Ensure you're in a supported AWS region.
2. **Monitor network conditions** - Check for routing issues or congestion.
3. **Log your requests** - Monitor request timing to identify where latency bottlenecks occur. Log both request initiation and response times to pinpoint whether delays are from network transit, API processing, or client-side handling.

## Support

If you need further assistance, please reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/jup).

* Share your request logs and ensure they include latency breakdowns.
* Provide details about your server setup and network configuration.
* Log response header's CloudFront request ID to help us identify the request.


# Payment Methods

Payment methods for Jupiter Portal

This section covers the payment method in Jupiter Portal.

## Overview

The payment methods provided on Portal only applies to the **PRO PLAN**.

* **Lite Plan**: Free tier, no payment required.
* **Pro Plan**: Tiered pricing.
* **Ultra Plan**: No payment via Portal needed.

:::note
For Lite and Ultra plans, you can use the API directly without any payment on Portal.

(Note that Ultra plan will require a free API Key to be generated first. You can find more details in [API Setup](/portal/setup) and [API Rate Limit](/portal/rate-limit) docs.)
:::

## Payment Method

We currently support 2 payment methods:

* Crypto - USDC on Solana via Helio
* Credit card - USD via CoinFlow

To pay for higher rate limits on Pro plan, you can choose either of the payment methods via the Portal UI.

### Crypto

| Property                       | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Payment**                    | The payment is done in Solana USDC only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Cadence**                    | The payment is currently done on a monthly basis, which means you will need to revisit Portal and manually renew each month.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Expiry**                     | 7 days before the plan expires, you will see the state change in the dashboard's table and receive an automated email as a reminder to renew. Upon expiry, your key will remain valid for a grace period but will be disabled (but not deleted) when it ends. |
| **Renewal**                    | If you choose to "Renew", the plan will be renewed to the same plan as the previous month. To change plan, you can upgrade/downgrade your plan at any time and cost will be pro-rated.                                                                        |
| **Fee**                        | Jupiter incurs the payment service fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Changing of payment method** | From Crypto to Credit Card:<br />1. Wait for plan to expire<br />2. Pay using the credit card payment method.                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Changing of cards**          | For security, changing of cards require a few extra steps and cannot be done in the middle of the subscription.<br />1. Cancel current plan<br />2. Wait for plan to expire<br />3. Resubscribe a plan with the new card.                                                                                                                          |

| **Downgrading of plans**       | You can downgrade by cancelling your plan and subscribing to a lower plan after expiry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Cancellation of plans**      | No refund will be given for unused days and the Pro plan will continue until the expected expiry date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Changing of payment method** | From Credit Card to Crypto:<br />1. Cancel current plan so it does not automatically renew<br />2. Wait for plan to expire<br />3. Pay using the crypto payment method.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Other Caveats**              | - Registered card address must be the billing address.<br />- No usage of disposable cards as payments are made for a recurring subscription plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |


# Rate Limit
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/portal/rate-limit

Rate limiting details of Jupiter APIs

In this section, you can find the rate limiting details of Jupiter API.

## Overview

**Fixed Rate Limit**

* All Jupiter APIs that are public and documented are free to use via the Lite tier.
* By purchasing a Pro plan, you are only accessing higher rate limits with no differences in usage nor freshness of data.

**Dynamic Rate Limit**

* Only Ultra Swap API has a unique dynamic rate limit system, [you can find more details in this section](#dynamic-rate-limit).

**API Key rules**

* API Keys are universal

  * Use the same API Key for Ultra Swap API (Dynamic Rate Limit) and all Pro APIs `api.jup.ag` (Fixed Rate Limit).
  * You do not need an API Key for Lite APIs `lite-api.jup.ag`.

* Rate limits apply on a per account basis, not to individual API keys.

| API Tier  | Rate Limit Model  | API Key Required | Base URL                      |
| :-------- | :---------------- | :--------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Lite**  | Fixed (Free Tier) | No               | `https://lite-api.jup.ag/**`  |
| **Pro**   | Fixed (Tiered)    | Yes              | `https://api.jup.ag/**`       |
| **Ultra** | Dynamic           | Yes              | `https://api.jup.ag/ultra/**` |

## Fixed Rate Limit

The Fixed Rate Limit system applies to the Lite and Pro plans (does not include Ultra Swap API), using the sliding window method to enforce request quotas.

| Property                | Lite                       | Pro                           |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Base URL**            | `https://lite-api.jup.ag/` | `https://api.jup.ag/`         |
| **Cost**                | Free                       | Paid per month, based on tier |
| **API Key**             | Not required               | Required                      |
| **Requests Per Minute** | 60                         | Based on tier                 |
| **Window**              | 60 seconds                 | 10 seconds                    |

### Rate Limit

Rate limits are defined over 10-second windows (except Lite at 60-second window). For example, if your tier allows 100 requests per 10 seconds, any more within that window will receive a 429 response, regardless of how few you used in the previous window.

| Tier    | Est. Requests per Minute | Requests Per Period | Sliding Window Period |
| :------ | :----------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------- |
| Lite    | 60                       | 60                  | 60 seconds            |
| Pro I   | \~600                    | 100                 | 10 seconds            |
| Pro II  | \~3,000                  | 500                 | 10 seconds            |
| Pro III | \~6,000                  | 1,000               | 10 seconds            |
| Pro IV  | \~30,000                 | 5,000               | 10 seconds            |

Requests are distributed to each bucket:

1. **Price API Bucket** – dedicated for `/price/v3/` only - separate from Default Bucket.
2. **Default Bucket** – used for all APIs except the Price API.

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  * Each bucket enforces its own sliding window independently.
  * For example, Pro II = 500 per 10 seconds to the Default Bucket and 500 per 10 seconds to the Price API Bucket.
  * Lite users do not have a separate Price API Bucket — all requests are counted against the Default Bucket.
</Info>

## Dynamic Rate Limit

<Note>
  **INFO**

  Dynamic Rate Limit is currently in BETA.

  * The rate limit is subject to changes as we experiment with the Dynamic Rate Limit system.
  * If you find that the rate limit is too restrictive, please reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/jup).
</Note>

The [**Ultra Swap API**](/docs/ultra) uses a unique rate limiting mechanism that scales with your **executed swap volume** over time.

| Property                | Dynamic                                 |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| **Base URL**            | `https://api.jup.ag/ultra/`             |
| **Cost**                | Free to use, but Ultra incurs swap fees |
| **API Key**             | Required                                |
| **Requests Per Minute** | Base Quota + Added Quota                |

### How Dynamic Rate Limit Works

Every **10 minutes**

* The system aggregates your swap volume from `/execute` on Ultra for **the current rolling day** (volume of (current timestamp - 1 day) up to present).
* After which, the Added Quota will update, which will be added on top of the Base Quota.

| Swap Volume | Requests Per Period       | Sliding Window Period |
| :---------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------- |
| \$0         | 50 Base + 0 Added = 50    | 10 seconds            |
| \$10,000    | 50 Base + 1 Added = 51    | 10 seconds            |
| \$100,000   | 50 Base + 11 Added = 61   | 10 seconds            |
| \$1,000,000 | 50 Base + 115 Added = 165 | 10 seconds            |

## Managing Rate Limits

If you receive a 429 response, you should:

1. Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic
2. Wait for sliding window to allow for more requests
3. **Upgrade your tier (Pro)** or **scale your Ultra usage** to unlock higher limits.

<Warning>
  **CAUTION**

  Bursting beyond your allocation may result in **temporary 429s/rate limits**, even after the refill period. Avoid aggressive retry patterns.
</Warning>

## Types of Plans

Depending on your needs, you can choose from the following plans. For more detailed understanding of the rate limiting of each plan, [please refer to this doc](/portal/rate-limit).

| Plan  | Rate Limit Model                                  | Why choose this plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :---- | :------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lite  | Free Tier                                         | You are just starting out and want to test the Jupiter APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Pro   | Fixed Tiered Rate Limits                          | Both small projects or large enterprises can utilize this with the tiered rate limits. Rate limits range from 1 RPS to 500 RPS plans.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Ultra | Dynamic Rate Limits based on executed swap volume | [Using Ultra Swap API comes with many benefits](/docs/ultra) where Jupiter will handle slippage, transaction sending, and more without the need of an RPC from you. With that, the Ultra Swap API is governed by a Dynamic Rate Limit model that will scale with your swap executions. |


# AI Workflow
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/resources/ai-workflow

How to use Jupiter docs with AI tools

The Jupiter documentation is optimized for AI-assisted development through our [`llms.txt` file](/llms.txt) or [`llms-full.txt` file](/llms-full.txt), which provides a structured index of all our APIs, guides, and resources. This page shows you how to leverage AI tools effectively when building with Jupiter.

## llms.txt

<Card title="llms.txt" href="/llms.txt" icon="file" horizontal>
  Open the llms.txt for Jupiter docs
</Card>

A typical `llms.txt` file is a plain Markdown file with:

* The **site title** as an H1 heading.
* **Sections** for each major area of the docs, with links and short descriptions for each page.

Example structure:

```mdx  theme={null}
# Jupiter

## Docs

- [Build with Jupiter](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/index.md)
- [Get Started](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/get-started/index.md): Welcome to Jupiter’s Developer Docs. Whether you’re building your own DeFi superapp or integrating a swap into an existing application, we provide the tools and infrastructure you need to succeed.
- [Overview](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/docs/ultra/index.md): Overview of Ultra Swap and its features.
- [API Reference](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/api-reference/index.md): Overview of Jupiter API Reference
- [Jupiter Tool Kits](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/tool-kits/index.md): Powerful developer tools and SDKs that help you integrate Jupiter products into your applications with minimal effort.
- [About Routing](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/docs/routing/index.md): The types of routing engines used in Jupiter's Swap product
- [Updates](https://jupiter.mintlify.app/updates/index.md): API Announcements and Changes
```

This structured approach allows LLMs to efficiently process your documentation at a high level and locate relevant content for user queries, improving the accuracy and speed of AI-assisted documentation searches.

## llms-full.txt

In addition to `llms.txt`, Jupiter also provides a [`llms-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt) file. While `llms.txt` offers a concise, high-level index of the documentation, `llms-full.txt` contains the entire documentation site as context for AI tools - including every line description and code examples.

<Card title="llms-full.txt" href="/llms-full.txt" icon="file" horizontal>
  Open the llms-full.txt for Jupiter docs
</Card>

* **For LLMs and AI tools** that require a complete, granular map of the documentation for deep indexing or advanced search.
* **For developers** who want to see every available page and resource in one place.
* **For building custom AI workflows** that benefit from the most detailed documentation context.

Learn how to customize Jupiter Plugin's appearance and behavior.

<Info>
  Try out the [Plugin Playground](https://plugin.jup.ag/) to experience the full swap features and see the different customization options with code snippets.

  For the full customization options, you can refer to the [repository](https://github.com/jup-ag/plugin/blob/main/src/types/index.d.ts).
</Info>

If you are using TypeScript, you can use the type declaration file to get the full type definitions for the Plugin.

<Accordion title="Full TypeScript Declaration">
  ```js  theme={null}
    declare global {
      interface Window {
          Jupiter: JupiterPlugin;
      }
  }

  export type WidgetPosition = 'bottom-left' | 'bottom-right' | 'top-left' | 'top-right';
  export type WidgetSize = 'sm' | 'default';
  export type SwapMode = "ExactInOrOut" | "ExactIn" | "ExactOut";
  export type DEFAULT_EXPLORER = 'Solana Explorer' | 'Solscan' | 'Solana Beach' | 'SolanaFM';

  export interface FormProps {
      swapMode?: SwapMode;
      initialAmount?: string;
      initialInputMint?: string;
      initialOutputMint?: string;
      fixedAmount?: boolean;
      fixedMint?: string;

      enableWalletPassthrough?: boolean;
      passthroughWalletContextState?: WalletContextState;
      onRequestConnectWallet?: () => void | Promise<void>;
      onSwapError?: ({
          error,

  export { };
  ```
</Accordion>

## Display Modes

Jupiter Plugin offers three distinct display modes to suit different use cases:

### 1. Integrated Mode

The integrated mode embeds the swap form directly into your application's layout. This is ideal for creating a seamless swap experience within your dApp.

```js  theme={null}
{
  displayMode: "integrated";
  integratedTargetId: string; // Required: ID of the container element
  containerStyles?: {
    width?: string;
    height?: string;
    borderRadius?: string;
    overflow?: string;
  };
  containerClassName?: string;
}
```

### 2. Widget Mode

The widget mode creates a floating swap form that can be positioned in different corners of the screen. Perfect for quick access to swaps without taking up too much space.

```js  theme={null}
{
  displayMode: "widget";
  widgetStyle?: {
    position?: "top-left" | "top-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-right";
    size?: "sm" | "default";
  };
}
```

### 3. Modal Mode

The modal mode displays the swap form in a popup overlay. This is useful when you want to keep the swap form hidden until needed.

```js  theme={null}
{
  displayMode: "modal";
}
```

## Form Props Configuration

The `formProps` object allows you to customize the initial state and behavior of the swap form! This can be useful for use cases like fixed token swaps for memecoin communities or fixed amount payments.

```js  theme={null}
{
  displayMode: "modal";
  formProps?: {
    swapMode?: SwapMode; // Set the swap mode to "ExactIn", "ExactOut", or default to "ExactInOrOut"

    initialAmount?: string; // Pre-fill the swap amount (e.g. "100")
    initialInputMint?: string; // Pre-select the input token by its mint address
    initialOutputMint?: string; // Pre-select the output token by its mint address

    fixedAmount?: boolean; // When true, users cannot change the swap amount
    fixedMint?: string; // Lock one side of the swap to a specific token by its mint address

    referralAccount?: string; // Set the referral account for the swap
    referralFee?: number; // Set the referral fee for the swap
  }
}
```

## Wallet Integration

Jupiter Plugin supports third-party wallet integration through the `enableWalletPassthrough` prop. This allows your application to pass through an existing wallet provider's connection in your application to Plugin. If you do not have an existing wallet provider, Plugin will provide a wallet adapter and connection - powered by [Unified Wallet Kit](/tool-kits/wallet-kit/).

```js  theme={null}
{
  // When true, wallet connection are handled by your dApp,
  // and use `syncProps()` to syncronise wallet state with Plugin.
  enableWalletPassthrough?: boolean;

    // Optional, if wallet state is ready, 
  // you can pass it in here, or just use `syncProps()`
  passthroughWalletContextState?: WalletContextState;

  // When enableWalletPassthrough is true, this allows Plugin
  // to callback your app's wallet connection flow
  onRequestConnectWallet?: () => void | Promise<void>;
}
```

## Event Handling

Jupiter Plugin provides event handlers to track swap operations:

```js  theme={null}
{
  onSuccess: ({ txid, swapResult, quoteResponseMeta }) => {
    // Handle successful swap
    console.log("Swap successful:", txid);
  };
  onSwapError: ({ error, quoteResponseMeta }) => {
    // Handle swap errors
    console.error("Swap failed:", error);
  }
}
```

## Branding

Jupiter Plugin supports branding through the `branding` prop. This allows you to customize the Plugin's logo and name to include your own branding.

```js  theme={null}
{
  branding?: {
    logoUri?: string;
    name?: string;
  };
}
```

## Color Theme

Jupiter Plugin supports a simplified way to customize the color theme. This allows you to match the appearance of the Plugin to your brand.

```js  theme={null}
/* In your global CSS file */
:root {
  --jupiter-plugin-primary: 199, 242, 132;
  --jupiter-plugin-background: 0, 0, 0;
  --jupiter-plugin-primaryText: 232, 249, 255;
  --jupiter-plugin-warning: 251, 191, 36;
  --jupiter-plugin-interactive: 33, 42, 54;
  --jupiter-plugin-module: 16, 23, 31;
}
```

  Refer to [Customization](/tool-kits/plugin/customization) and [FAQ](/tool-kits/plugin/faq) for more information.
</Note>

## Key Features

* **Seamless Integration**: Embed Jupiter's swap functionality directly into your application without redirects.
* **Multiple Display Options**: Choose between integrated, widget, or modal display modes.
* **Customizable Options**: Configure the swap form to match your application's needs.
* **RPC-less**: Integrate Plugin without any RPCs, Ultra handles transaction sending, wallet balances and token information.
* **Ultra Mode**: Access to all features of Ultra Mode, read more about it in the [Ultra Swap API docs](/docs/ultra/).

## Getting Started

When integrating Plugin, there are a few integration methods to think about, and choose the one that best fits your application's architecture and requirements.

### Integration Methods

* **Using Window Object** - Simplest way to add and initialize Plugin.
* [**Using NPM Package**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jup-ag/plugin) - Install via `npm install @jup-ag/plugin` and initialize as a module (will require you to maintain its dependencies).

### Wallet Integration

* **Wallet Standard Support**: For applications without existing wallet provider, Plugin will provide a wallet adapter and connection - powered by [Unified Wallet Kit](/tool-kits/wallet-kit/).
* **Passthrough Wallet**: For applications with existing wallet provider(s), set `enableWalletPassthrough=true` with context, and Plugin will allow the application to pass through the existing wallet provider's connection to Plugin.

### Adding Fees to plugin

* **Referral Account**: You can create a referral account via [scripts](/docs/ultra/add-fees-to-ultra) or [Referral Dashboard](https://referral.jup.ag/).
* **Referral Fee**: You can set the referral fee and account in the `formProps` interface when you initialize the Plugin.

# Next.js App Example
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/tool-kits/plugin/nextjs-app-example

In this guide, we'll walk you through from scratch the steps to integrate Jupiter Plugin into a Next.js application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system.

**Node.js and npm**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

## Step 1: Create a New Next.js Project

Head to your preferred directory and create a new Next.js project using `create-next-app` with TypeScript template (you can use other templates or methods to start your project too):

```bash  theme={null}
npx create-next-app@latest plugin-demo --typescript
cd plugin-demo
npm run dev
```

## Step 2: Add TypeScript Support

Create a type declaration file `plugin.d.ts` in your project's `/src/types` folder:

```js  theme={null}
declare global {
  interface Window {
    Jupiter: JupiterPlugin;
  }
};
export {};
```

<Accordion title="Full TypeScript Declaration">
  ```js  theme={null}
   declare global {
      interface Window {
          Jupiter: JupiterPlugin;
      }
  }

  export type WidgetPosition = 'bottom-left' | 'bottom-right' | 'top-left' | 'top-right';
  export type WidgetSize = 'sm' | 'default';
  export type SwapMode = "ExactInOrOut" | "ExactIn" | "ExactOut";
  export type DEFAULT_EXPLORER = 'Solana Explorer' | 'Solscan' | 'Solana Beach' | 'SolanaFM';

  export interface FormProps {
      swapMode?: SwapMode;
      initialAmount?: string;
      initialInputMint?: string;
      initialOutputMint?: string;
      fixedAmount?: boolean;
      fixedMint?: string;
      referralAccount?: string;
      referralFee?: number;
  }

  export interface IInit {
      localStoragePrefix?: string;
      formProps?: FormProps;
      defaultExplorer?: DEFAULT_EXPLORER;
      autoConnect?: boolean;
      displayMode?: 'modal' | 'integrated' | 'widget';
      integratedTargetId?: string;
      widgetStyle?: {
          position?: WidgetPosition;
          size?: WidgetSize;
      };
      containerStyles?: CSSProperties;
      containerClassName?: string;
      enableWalletPassthrough?: boolean;
      passthroughWalletContextState?: WalletContextState;
      onRequestConnectWallet?: () => void | Promise<void>;
      onSwapError?: ({
          error,
          quoteResponseMeta,
      }: {
          error?: TransactionError;
          quoteResponseMeta: QuoteResponse | null;
      }) => void;
      onSuccess?: ({
          txid,
          swapResult,
          quoteResponseMeta,
      }: {
          txid: string;
          swapResult: SwapResult;
          quoteResponseMeta: QuoteResponse | null;
      }) => void;
      onFormUpdate?: (form: IForm) => void;
      onScreenUpdate?: (screen: IScreen) => void;
  }

  export interface JupiterPlugin {
      _instance: JSX.Element | null;
      init: (props: IInit) => void;
      resume: () => void;
      close: () => void;
      root: Root | null;
      enableWalletPassthrough: boolean;
      onRequestConnectWallet: IInit['onRequestConnectWallet'];
      store: ReturnType<typeof createStore>;
      syncProps: (props: { passthroughWalletContextState?: IInit['passthroughWalletContextState'] }) => void;
      onSwapError: IInit['onSwapError'];
      onSuccess: IInit['onSuccess'];
      onFormUpdate: IInit['onFormUpdate'];
      onScreenUpdate: IInit['onScreenUpdate'];
      localStoragePrefix: string;
  }

  export { };
  ```
</Accordion>

## Step 3: Embed the Plugin Script

For Next.js applications, you can add the script in two ways:

### Using App Router (Next.js 13+)

In your `app/layout.tsx`:

```js  theme={null}
import Script from "next/script";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <Script
          src="https://plugin.jup.ag/plugin-v1.js"
          strategy="beforeInteractive"
          data-preload
          defer
        />
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Using Pages Router

In your `pages/_app.tsx`:

```js  theme={null}
import "@/styles/globals.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import Script from "next/script";

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <Script
        src="https://plugin.jup.ag/plugin-v1.js"
        strategy="beforeInteractive"
        data-preload
        defer
      />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Step 4: Initialize Plugin

There are two ways to initialize Jupiter Plugin in a Next.js application:

### Method 1: Using Window Object

Create a new component for the plugin at `components/plugin.tsx`:

```js  theme={null}
"use client";

import React, { useEffect } from "react";

export default function PluginComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
      window.Jupiter.init({
        displayMode: "widget",
        integratedTargetId: "jupiter-plugin",
      });
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Jupiter Plugin Demo</h1>
      <div
        id="jupiter-plugin"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Method 2: Using @jup-ag/plugin Package

<Warning>
  **WARNING**

  Do note that using this method will require you to maintain its dependencies.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Install the package:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm install @jup-ag/plugin
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Create a new component for the plugin at `components/plugin.tsx`:

    ```js  theme={null}
    "use client";

    import React, { useEffect } from "react";
    import "@jup-ag/plugin/css";

    export default function PluginComponent() {
      useEffect(() => {
        import("@jup-ag/plugin").then((mod) => {
          const { init } = mod;
          init({
            displayMode: "widget",
            integratedTargetId: "jupiter-plugin",
          });
        });
      }, []);

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Jupiter Plugin Demo</h1>
          <div id="jupiter-plugin" />
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Add the Plugin Component to Your Page

In your `app/page.tsx` (or `pages/index.tsx` if you're using Pages Router):

```js  theme={null}
import PluginComponent from '@/components/plugin';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-rows-[20px_1fr_20px] items-center justify-items-center min-h-screen p-8 pb-20 gap-16 sm:p-20 font-[family-name:var(--font-geist-sans)]">
      <PluginComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

There you have it! You've successfully integrated Jupiter Plugin into your Next.js application.

* Please test the swap functionality and check the transaction.

    onFormUpdate: IInit['onFormUpdate'];
    onScreenUpdate: IInit['onScreenUpdate'];
    localStoragePrefix: string;
  }

  export { };
  ```
</Accordion>

## Step 3: Embed the Plugin Script

In your `/public/index.html`, add the Jupiter Plugin script:

```bash  theme={null}
<head>
  <script src="https://plugin.jup.ag/plugin-v1.js" data-preload defer></script>
</head>
```

## Step 4: Initialize Plugin

There are two ways to initialize Jupiter Plugin in a React application:

### Method 1: Using Window Object

In your `/src/App.tsx`, use the following code to initialize the plugin.

```bash  theme={null}
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import './types/plugin.d';

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Initialize plugin
    window.Jupiter.init({
      displayMode: "widget",
      integratedTargetId: "jupiter-plugin",
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Jupiter Plugin Demo</h1>
      <div id="jupiter-plugin" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Method 2: Using @jup-ag/plugin Package

<Warning>
  **WARNING**

  Do note that using this method will require you to maintain its dependencies.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Install the package:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm install @jup-ag/plugin
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Initialize the plugin:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    import React, { useEffect } from "react";
    import "@jup-ag/plugin/css";
    import "./App.css";
    import "./types/plugin.d";

    export default function App() {
      useEffect(() => {
        import("@jup-ag/plugin").then((mod) => {
          const { init } = mod;
          init({
            displayMode: "widget",
            integratedTargetId: "jupiter-plugin",
          });
        });
      }, []);

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Jupiter Plugin Demo</h1>
          <div id="jupiter-plugin" />
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

There you have it! You've successfully integrated Jupiter Plugin into your Next.js application.

* Please test the swap functionality and check the transaction.
* If you require more customizations, check out the [Plugin Playground](https://plugin.jup.ag) or the [Customization](/tool-kits/plugin/customization) documentation.

# Referral Program
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/tool-kits/referral-program

The Referral Program is an open-source program used by Jupiter Programs (or any other programs) to enable developers to earn fees via our APIs.

<Note>
  **REFERRAL PROGRAM SOURCE CODE**

  [Open Source Repository](https://github.com/TeamRaccoons/referral): To understand and make use of the referral program better.
</Note>

## Jupiter API Integrators

The Jupiter Programs use the Referral Program to allow developers to earn fees when integrating with Jupiter. Below are some resources to help you quickly get started. There are a different ways to setup such as via the Jupiter Referral Dashboard or using the provided scripts.

* [Jupiter Referral Dashboard](https://referral.jup.ag/): To view and manage your referral accounts used with Jupiter APIs.
* [Add Fees to Ultra Swap API](/docs/ultra/add-fees-to-ultra): To add fees to your Ultra Swap API integration.
* [Add Fees to Swap and Trigger API](/docs/swap/add-fees-to-swap): To add fees to your Swap and Trigger API integration.
* [Add Fees to Jupiter Plugin](/tool-kits/plugin#adding-fees-to-plugin): To add fees to your Plugin integration.

## Other Program Integrators

### Project Usage

If you have a project/product that runs a program on the Solana blockchain, you can integrate the Referral Program to allow/share revenue with the integrators of your program.

Similar to how Jupiter Programs uses the Referral Program to help developers earn fees and/or share the revenue with Jupiter. For example, Jupiter Ultra uses the Jupiter Swap program which relies on the Referral Program.

* Create a `Project` by calling `initialize_project` with your chosen `base` key and a project `name` (`base` key refers to a key identifier of your project).
* Set a `default_share_bps` to share the fees with your referrers (or integrators).
* An example of a `Project` account: [Jupiter Ultra Project](https://solscan.io/account/DkiqsTrw1u1bYFumumC7sCG2S8K25qc2vemJFHyW2wJc)

### Referrer Usage

If you are a referrer such as a developer or integrator of a project that runs a program on the Solana blockchain, you can create the necessary accounts via the Referral Program to earn fees.

* The program must be integrated with the Referral Program.
* Create a `Referral` account by calling `initialize_referral_account` with the correct `Project` account, the `Referral` account, and your own `Partner` account (`Partner` account is the admin of this referral account).
* Create the necessary `Referral` token accounts for the `Referral` account to receive fees in.

<Note>
  The Jupiter Mobile Adapter allows you to integrate Jupiter Mobile login functionality into your app! By allowing Jupiter Mobile users to simply use the app to scan a QR code to login, they can utilize their wallets on Jupiter Mobile across any platform.
</Note>

## Overview

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Install [@jup-ag/jup-mobile-adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jup-ag/jup-mobile-adapter)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Use `useWrappedReownAdapter` (Prerequisite to create an app id on [https://dashboard.reown.com/](https://dashboard.reown.com/))
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Add the `jupiterAdapter` to wallets
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisite

Building on top of the example in [Jupiter Wallet Extension example](/tool-kits/wallet-kit/jupiter-wallet-extension), we will pass in the Jupiter Mobile Adapter (which uses Reown's AppKit).

## Step 1: Install dependency

You will need to install the following dependency:

```bash  theme={null}
npm i @jup-ag/jup-mobile-adapter
```

<Card title="Download Jupiter Mobile">

## Step 2: Get Reown project ID

You need to input the project ID on from your [Reown's dashboard](https://dashboard.reown.com/), before you can use the Jupiter Mobile Adapter. This project ID is required for the AppKit integration that powers the mobile wallet connection functionality.

To get your project ID:

1. Visit [https://dashboard.reown.com/](https://dashboard.reown.com/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Create a new project
4. Copy the project ID from your project settings (should be in the navbar)

## Step 3: Add Jupiter Mobile Adapter to wallets

In your `/src/app/page.tsx` file, add the Jupiter Mobile Adapter as a wallet.

```js expandable theme={null}
"use client";

import { Adapter, UnifiedWalletButton, UnifiedWalletProvider } from "@jup-ag/wallet-adapter";
import { useWrappedReownAdapter } from '@jup-ag/jup-mobile-adapter';
import { WalletNotification } from "../components/WalletNotification";
import { useMemo } from "react";

export default function Home() {
  // Initialize Jupiter Mobile Adapter with WalletConnect/Reown configuration
  // This adapter enables mobile wallet connections through WalletConnect protocol
  const { jupiterAdapter } = useWrappedReownAdapter({
    appKitOptions: {
      metadata: {
        name: 'Jupiter Wallet Kit Demo',
        description: `This is a Jupiter Wallet Kit Demo with Jupiter Mobile Adapter`,
        url: 'https://localhost:3000',
        icons: ['https://jup.ag/favicon.ico'],
      },
      projectId: '', // Get your project id from https://dashboard.reown.com/
      features: {
        analytics: false,
        socials: ['google', 'x', 'apple'],
        email: false,
      },
      // Disable built-in wallet list to use only Jupiter Mobile Adapter
      enableWallets: false,
    },
  });
  
  // Configure wallet adapters for the UnifiedWalletProvider
  // This memoized array includes the Jupiter Mobile Adapter and filters out any invalid adapters
  // The filter ensures each adapter has required properties (name and icon) before being used
  const wallets: Adapter[] = useMemo(() => {
      return [
        jupiterAdapter, // Jupiter Mobile Adapter with WalletConnect integration
      ].filter((item) => item && item.name && item.icon) as Adapter[];
  }, []);

  return (
    <UnifiedWalletProvider
      wallets={wallets}
      config={{
        autoConnect: false,
        env: "mainnet-beta",
        metadata: {

# Jupiter Wallet Extension
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/tool-kits/wallet-kit/jupiter-wallet-extension

Using the Jupiter Wallet Kit, we can pass in the Jupiter Wallet Extension as a wallet in your app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system. This is what we will be using in this example.

**Node.js and npm**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

## Step 1: Create a new project

Head to your preferred directory and create a new project using `create-next-app` with TypeScript template (you can use other templates or methods to start your project too):

```bash  theme={null}
npx create-next-app@latest wallet-kit-demo --typescript
cd wallet-kit-demo
npm run dev
```

## Step 2: Install dependency

```bash  theme={null}
npm i @jup-ag/wallet-adapter
```

<Card title="Download Jupiter Wallet Extension" href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/iledlaeogohbilgbfhmbgkgmpplbfboh" icon="wallet" horizontal />

## Step 3: Add notification functionality

In `/src/components`, create a new file `WalletNotification.tsx` with the following content:

In this example, we will use a simple browser notification system to handle the wallet connection events.

```typescript expandable theme={null}
"use client";

interface IWalletNotification {
  publicKey?: string;
  shortAddress?: string;
  walletName?: string;
  metadata?: {
    name: string;
    url: string;
    icon: string;
    supportedTransactionVersions?: any;
  };
}

// Simple notification component - you can replace this with your preferred notification library
const showNotification = (message: string, type: 'success' | 'error' | 'info' = 'info') => {
  // For demo purposes, we'll use browser notifications
  // In a real app, you'd want to use a proper notification library like react-hot-toast
  console.log(`[${type.toUpperCase()}] ${message}`);
  
  // Simple visual feedback
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    const notification = document.createElement('div');
    notification.style.cssText = `
      position: fixed;
      top: 20px;
      right: 20px;
      background: ${type === 'error' ? '#ef4444' : type === 'success' ? '#10b981' : '#3b82f6'};
      color: white;
      padding: 12px 16px;
      border-radius: 8px;
      z-index: 9999;
      font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif;
      box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
    `;
    notification.textContent = message;
    document.body.appendChild(notification);
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      document.body.removeChild(notification);
    }, 3000);
  }
};

export const WalletNotification = {
  onConnect: ({ shortAddress, walletName }: IWalletNotification) => {
    showNotification(`Connected to ${walletName} (${shortAddress})`, 'success');
  },
  onConnecting: ({ walletName }: IWalletNotification) => {
    showNotification(`Connecting to ${walletName}...`, 'info');
  },
  onDisconnect: ({ walletName }: IWalletNotification) => {
    showNotification(`Disconnected from ${walletName}`, 'info');
  },
  onError: ({ walletName }: IWalletNotification) => {
    showNotification(`Failed to connect to ${walletName}`, 'error');
  },
  onNotInstalled: ({ walletName }: IWalletNotification) => {
    showNotification(`${walletName} is not installed`, 'error');
  },
};

export default WalletNotification;
```

## Step 4: Wrap your app in the Wallet Kit

In `/src/app/page.tsx`, wrap your app with `<UnifiedWalletProvider />`.

This example code covers the base usage of the wallet kit which allows all wallets in your browser to be detected and used. If you have downloaded the [Jupiter Wallet Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/iledlaeogohbilgbfhmbgkgmpplbfboh) <Icon icon="download" />, you should be able to see and connect to it.

```typescript expandable theme={null}
"use client";

import { Adapter, UnifiedWalletButton, UnifiedWalletProvider } from "@jup-ag/wallet-adapter";
import { WalletNotification } from "../components/WalletNotification";

export default function Home() {
  // You can add specific wallet adapters here if needed
  // For now, we'll rely on the Unified Wallet Kit's built-in wallet discovery
  const wallets: Adapter[] = [];

  return (
    <UnifiedWalletProvider
      wallets={wallets}
      config={{
        autoConnect: false,
        env: "mainnet-beta",
        metadata: {
          name: "Jupiter Wallet Kit Demo",
          description: "A demo application showcasing the Jupiter Wallet Kit",
          url: "https://localhost:3000",
          iconUrls: ["https://jup.ag/favicon.ico"],
        },
        notificationCallback: WalletNotification,
        walletlistExplanation: {
          href: "https://dev.jup.ag/tool-kits/wallet-kit",
        },
        theme: "dark",
        lang: "en",
      }}
    >
      <div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 to-gray-800 flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-8">
        <div className="max-w-md w-full space-y-8 text-center">
          <div>
            <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-4">
              Jupiter Wallet Extension Demo
            </h1>
            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-8">
              Connect your Solana wallet to get started
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
            <UnifiedWalletButton />
          </div>
                          
          <div className="text-sm text-gray-400">
            <p>Powered by Jupiter Wallet Kit</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </UnifiedWalletProvider>
  );
}
```

There you have it! You've successfully integrated Jupiter Wallet Kit into your Next.js application and able to connect the Jupiter Wallet Extension!

* Please test the wallet functionality and build into your own application.

# Updates
Source: https://dev.jup.ag/updates/index

Announcements and Changes

<Update label="October 2025" description="">
  ## Ultra V3

  We're excited to introduce Ultra V3, featuring major improvements on quoting
  and swap execution for the Ultra Swap API.

  * [Read the full technical deep dive in the Jupiter Developers Blog](/blog/ultra-v3).

  * **Improved Routers in Meta Aggregation**: Granular splitting of 0.01%; and began usage
    of Golden-section and Brent's method for routing algorithms.

  * **Ultra Signaling for Tighter Prop AMM Quotes**: Ultra signals to Prop AMMs, allowing
    them to confidently provide tighter quotes by distinguishing Ultra trades as "non-toxic"
    order flow from other "toxic" order flow - 3 bps tighter (50% better) quotes for our Ultra
    users compared to other platforms.

  * **Predictive Execution to Simulate Executable Price & Potential Slippage**: Simulates routes
    on-chain to verify executable price versus quote and predict potential slippage to select the
    route with the least overall incurred slippage at the time of execution.

  * **ShadowLane: Sub-Second Transaction Landing & MEV Protection**: Transaction sending
    infrastructure helps reduce landing time by 50-66% compared to traditional methods and
    significantly reduces MEV opportunities by 34x.

  * **Real-Time Slippage Estimator (RTSE) Optimizations**: Automatically prioritize
    slippage-protected routes over purely price-optimized routes and increase volatility
    sensitivity for tokens with high historical volatility patterns.

  * **Gasless Support Coverage**: Expanded gasless support coverage to Token2022 tokens,
    memecoin-to-memecoin swaps (when liquidity permits), and reduced minimum trade size to \~\$10 USD.

  * **Just-In-Time Market Revival**: Dynamically re-indexes markets to enable tradability for all tokens.

  * **Reduce Pre-Graduation Quote Latency**: Optimized pre-graduated bonding curve markets routing logic
    by skipping multi-route aggregation to improve quote latency from 200ms to 10ms - a 90% improvement.

  * **Sunsetted Legacy Jupiter Swap API**: As part of this upgrade, moving forward, we will be focusing our
    efforts on the ongoing development and improvement of Ultra V3 with our new router, Iris.

  * **[Try Ultra Swap API](/docs/ultra)**: Ultra V3 features are live in the Ultra Swap API V1, try it and let us know your feedback!

  ## Jupiter Aggregator V6 Program Update

  * 4 new instruction types are introduced:
    * `route_v2`
    * `exact_out_route_v2`
    * `shared_accounts_route_v2`
    * `shared_accounts_exact_out_route_v2`
  * You can find the details in the latest IDL: [Solscan](https://solscan.io/account/JUP6LkbZbjS1jKKwapdHNy74zcZ3tLUZoi5QNyVTaV4#programIdl).
  * V1 instructions will continue to be valid and usable.
  * This enables:
    * Collect fees when the swap pair consists of a Token2022 mint.
    * Set fee beyond the previous cap of 255 bps.

  ## Integrator Fee

  **Ultra Swap API**

  * Integrator fee for Ultra now supports Token2022 tokens.
  * No additional parameters are required, simply create Token2022 referral token accounts for your referral account.
  * You can find the details in the [Add Fees To Ultra Swap](/docs/ultra/add-fees-to-ultra) guide.

  **Legacy Swap API**

  * Integrator fee for Legacy Swap now supports Token2022 tokens.
  * New [`instructionVersion` parameter](/api-reference/swap/quote#parameter-instruction-version) is introduced to the Legacy Swap API's Quote endpoint to support the new instruction types.
  * To collect fees in Token2022 tokens, create Token2022 token accounts and pass in via `feeAccount`.
  * You can find the details in the [Add Fees To Swap](/docs/swap/add-fees-to-swap) guide.
</Update>

<Update label="June 2025" description="">
  ## Deprecation of Price API V2 and Tokens API V1

  [**Price API upgrades to V3**](/docs/price/v3) to support more reliable and timely pricing data - derived by the last swap price (across all transactions) and a set of heuristics to ensure the accuracy of the price and eliminate any outliers.

  [**Tokens API upgrades to V2**](/docs/tokens/v2) to support an easier and reliable usage with new data addition such as [Organic Score](/docs/tokens/organic-score), more trading categories like toporganicscore, and more.

  <Danger>
    **Action Required**

    * If you are using **Price API V2** and **Tokens API V1**
    * Please migrate to their new versions respectively
    * The older versions will be deprecated by 30 September 2025
  </Danger>

  ## API Gateway: Improvements

  **Improved API Gateway!**

  For those that have been using the new hostnames at `api.jup.ag/**`, we have made improvements to the infrastructure

  * Reduced latency in responses and much more consistent now
  * Infrastructure costs reduction (will help us look into reducing costs of the plans with higher rate limits)

  **Dual endpoint moving forward.**

  We will be deploying 2 different endpoints, 1 for free usage and 1 for plans with higher rate limits via [https://portal.jup.ag/](https://portal.jup.ag/)

  * `api.jup.ag` will serve only pro/paid users
  * `lite-api.jup.ag` will be the endpoint to provide free usage

  <Danger>
    **Action Required (Free plan)**

    * Migrate to `lite-api.jup.ag` **BY 1 MAY 2025**
    * The paths remain unchanged, only domain/hostname changes
    * The same rate limits still apply
    * You do not need an API Key to use the APIs for free
    * If you are still on `api.jup.ag` without an API key, you will get a 401 response

    **NO Action Required (Pro plan)**

    * Your usage on `api.jup.ag` remains unchanged
    * You can only use `api.jup.ag` with an API Key
  </Danger>

  ## Trigger API: New Hostname and Breaking Changes

  * The `/limit/v2` path will be deprecated soon, please update your API calls to use the `/trigger/v1` path immediately.
  * `/execute` endpoint is introduced.
  * `/createOrder` endpoint now includes an additional `requestId` parameter to be used with the `/execute` endpoint.
  * `/cancelOrder` endpoint only builds the transaction for 1 order, while `/cancelOrders` endpoint builds the transaction for multiple orders.
  * The `tx` field in the responses are now `transaction` or `transactions`.
  * `/getTriggerOrders` endpoint is introduces a new format to get either active or historical orders (based on the query parameters).
  * [Please refer to the documentation for usage](/docs/trigger/create-order).
